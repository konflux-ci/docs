= Testing and Releasing a Single Component

By default, {ProductName} treats applications as a set of dependent components. A example would be frontend and backend
components. A user may typically want to build, test, and release these components together
to ensure there are compatible.

Applications may also consist of independent components. If a user wants to group components together in an application
a failure in one component will normally prevent any components from releasing.
In **Single Component Mode**, however, each component in an application is separated so that one component's failing
Enterprise Contract Policy will not prevent the other components from releasing.

== Enabling Single Component Mode

Single component mode works by analyzing the Snapshot that is being used for Integration Tests and Releasing.
A Snapshot created due to a single component being built is the only Snapshot type that may be used for this
mode.

=== Enabling Single Component Mode for Enterprise Contract Integration Test Scenarios

Single Component Mode can be enabled either by making a change to the Integration Test Scenario custom resource
or by using the UI.

* Update the custom resource by adding the parameter *SINGLE_COMPONENT* with a value of *true*

[source,yaml]
.integration-test-scenario.yaml
----
spec:
  params:
    - name: SINGLE_COMPONENT
      value: 'true'
----

[NOTE]
====
You need to apply the change using *kubectl*
====

* Alternatively, you may edit the Integration Test Scenario using the HAC UI as follows:

=== Enabling Single Component Mode for Releases

Single Component Mode can be enabled for Releases by making a change to the ReleasePlanAdmission custom resource.

* Update the custom resource by adding the field *singleComponentMode* under _.spec.data_ with a value of *true*

[source,yaml]
.release-plan-admission.yaml
----
spec:
  data:
    singleComponentMode: true
----

[NOTE]
====
You need to apply the change using *kubectl*
====

=== Verifying Test Results and Releases in Single Component Mode

* Once your changes have been applied, you can verify that the mode is in fact activated.

==== Verifying Enterprise Contract Integration Test Scenario results

* Navigate to the logs of your Enterprise Contract Integration Test Scenario pipeline.
* Locate the *reduce* step in the log.
* It should resemble the following output:

[source]
--
[reduce] Single Component mode? true
[reduce] SNAPSHOT_CREATION_TYPE: component
[reduce] SNAPSHOT_CREATION_COMPONENT: comp2
[reduce] Single Component mode is true and Snapshot type is component
[reduce] COMPONENT_COUNT: 1
--

==== Verifying Release pipeline logs

* Navigate to the logs of your Release pipeline.
* Locate the *reduce-snapshot* task in the logs.
* It should resemble the following output:

[source]
--
reduce-snapshot
