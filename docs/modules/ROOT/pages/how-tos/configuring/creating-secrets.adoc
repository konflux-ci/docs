= Creating secrets for your builds

When you build your pipeline, you might want to add tasks that require **secrets** in order to access external resources.

NOTE: One such task is the link:https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/build-definitions/tree/main/task/sast-snyk-check[sast-snyk-check] task that uses the third-party service link:https://snyk.io/[snyk] to perform static application security testing (SAST) as a part of the default {ProductName} pipeline. Use this procedure to upload your snyk.io token. Name the secret `sast_snyk_task` so that the snyk task in the {ProductName} pipeline will recognize it and use it.

If you want to create an application using source code from GitLab, you need to add a GitLab access token to {ProductName} __before__ you create an application. For details, see <<Creating secrets for GitLab-sourced apps>> below.

.Procedure 

. In {ProductName}, from the left navigation menu, select **Secrets**.
. From the **Secrets** page, click **Add secret**.
. Select a secret type:
    * **Key/value secret**
    * **Image pull secret**
    * **Source secret**
. For **Secret name**, enter a unique name for your secret.
. Under **Key/value secret**, expand **Key/value 1**, then enter a key.
. For **Upload the file with value for your key or paste its contents**, do one of the following:
    * Click **Upload** to browse to, select, and upload the file that contains your key value.
    * Drag the file that contains your key value into the space under **Upload**.
    * Paste the contents of the file that contains your key value into the space under **Upload**.
  Click **Clear** to remove the contents of the space under **Upload**.
. Optional: Click **Add another key/value**.
. Optional: Under **Labels**, add a label to tag or provide more context for your secret.
. Click **Add secret**.

== Creating secrets for GitLab-sourced apps

Before you create an application using source code from GitLab, generate an access token for your GitLab repository and upload it to your {ProductName} workspace.

.Procedure

. In GitLab select your avatar, then select **Edit profile** > **Access Tokens** > **Add new token**.
. Select the following scopes: `api`, `read_repository`, and `write_repository`.
. Optional: If your GitLab instance supports setting token role, set a role to `Maintainer`.
. Select **Create personal access token**.
. Add a token to your {ProductName} workspace by running the `oc create` command and creating a new YAML file with a secret:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc create -f GL-secret.yaml
----

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: pipelines-as-code-secret
  namespace: <YOUR NAMESPACE>
  labels:
    appstudio.redhat.com/credentials: scm
    appstudio.redhat.com/scm.host: <gitlab-host> # for example, gitlab.com
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
stringData:
  password: <PERSONAL GITLAB ACCESS TOKEN>
----

+
[NOTE]
====
Using the PAT authentication requires only the `password` key. The `username` should not be set. If you set both the `username` and `password` keys, the authentication type will be considered as `basic`, and a basic authentication client will be created using those credentials. This client might not work or can be considered as a deprecated login method by some Source Code Management (SCM) providers.
====

This secret will be used by the build service to perform both default and Pipeline-as-Code builds.

[IMPORTANT]
==== 
* Each workspace can contain only one set of credentials for each Source Control Management (SCM) system, such as GitHub or GitLab. It means you can’t add two different tokens for a GitLab repository to a single workspace.

* If you upload a GitLab access token to a workspace, {ProductName} won’t use the global GitHub application when accessing GitHub repositories.
