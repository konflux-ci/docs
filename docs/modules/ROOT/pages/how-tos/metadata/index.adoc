= Inspecting provenance and attestations

We are committed to providing exceptional security with {ProductName} by hardening the build platform and providing transparency into the build process and artifact's composition. By hardening the build platform, we enable multiple builds to run on a shared platform while preventing tampering from other running builds (link:https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.1/threats-overview[threats to the build process]). By providing transparency, we enable xref:/advanced-how-tos/managing-compliance-with-ec.adoc[policy evaluation] and auditability on the actual build process (link:https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.1/threats-overview[threats to the package selection]). This commitment means that {ProductName} conforms to the link:https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels#build-l3[SLSA Build Level 3] requirements.

Don't take our word on the transparency -- you can download and inspect these artifacts yourself! {ProductName} generates and pushes build metadata as OCI artifacts to the container registry alongside your software's build using the link:https://github.com/oras-project/artifacts-spec/blob/main/manifest-referrers-api.md[referrers API].

== Discovering the associated metadata

.Prerequisites

* Install the link:https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/installation/[Cosign] CLI tool.

* Install the link:https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/[jq] CLI tool.

* xref:/getting-started/cli.adoc[Login] to {ProductName}.

.Procedure

In the CLI, complete the following steps to discover the associated metadata for a component:

. Find the image for a xref:/how-tos/creating.adoc#finding-the-built-image[recently completed build pipeline] and export the value to the `IMAGE` environment variable
+
Example:
+
[source]
--
IMAGE=quay.io/redhat-user-workloads/workspace-tenant/application/component@sha256:<output omitted>
--

+
. Print a high-level overview of the artifact's metadata that {ProductName} has created for a component: 

+
[source]
--
cosign tree $IMAGE
--
+
Example output:
+
[source]
--
📦 Supply Chain Security Related artifacts for an image: quay.io/redhat-user-workload/workspace-tenant/application/component@sha256:<sha-digest>

└── 🔐 Signatures for an image tag: quay.io/redhat-user-workload/workspace-tenant/application/component:sha256-<sha-digest>.sig
   └── 🍒 sha256:<signature-sha-digest>
--

The `cosign tree` command will show all metadata associated to the artifact via the referrers API. The SBOM artifact contains the Software Bill of Materials. We have provided further procedures for you to view and inspect the xref:/how-tos/metadata/attestations.adoc[attestations] and xref:/how-tos/metadata/sboms.adoc[SBOMs] by {ProductName}.

== Additional resources
* Learn about the SLSA framework and xref:/index.adoc#supply-chain-security-through-slsa-conformity[how {ProductName} meets the requirements of SLSA Build Level 3].
* Red Hat's Enterprise Contract (EC) is a powerful tool that you can also use to verify your SLSA provenance; visit link:https://enterprisecontract.dev/docs/user-guide/main/cli.html#_validating_an_image[this page]  to learn how to use the EC CLI tool to verify your provenance. You will need the public key used by Tekton Chains, which you can find by following link:https://enterprisecontract.dev/docs/user-guide/main/cli.html#_finding_the_public_key[these instructions].
