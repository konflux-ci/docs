= Using Red Hat activation keys to access subscription content

Most Red Hat software requires a subscription to access. Activation keys are the preferred method for using Red Hat subscriptions with Konflux builds and are supported by the all types of container builds, including hermetic builds using the prefetch-dependencies task.

NOTE: Previously, mounting entitlement certificates directly as secrets was advocated but this is discouraged by Red Hat since those certificates are intended to be regularly revoked and refreshed by the subscription-manager system. Direct use of entitlement certificates is still supported by Konflux but discouraged. Entitlement certificate docs are xref:./entitlement-subscription.adoc[here].

To learn how to create an activation keys see the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/subscription_central/1-latest/html/getting_started_with_activation_keys_on_the_hybrid_cloud_console/index[Red Hat documentation].

When your activation key is created, you will need to create a secret with two values: your "org id" and the name of your activation key.


== Adding activation keys to the workspace

You will need to create one or more secrets in your Konflux namespace (one per activation key). First, decide what to name the secrets and the scope they should have. You can control the scope of the activation key you add with the name.

=== Adding subscription entitlement for an entire workspace

Both the `+buildah+` and `+prefetch-dependencies+` tasks accept an activation key with a default name of `+activation-key+`. If you use this name for your secret, all of the builds in your workspace will automatically use the activation key.

=== Adding subscription entitlement for a specific component build
Sometimes, you only want certain builds to have the activation key, particularly when you need to have more than one key with different repository configurations in the same workspace. To do this, choose a different name for your activation key secret (not `+activation-key+`). Then, add a parameter to your component's pipeline yaml:

----
- name: ACTIVATION_KEY
  value: my-secret-name
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
* If you want to use the feature to automatically update xref:ROOT:mintmaker:rpm-lockfile.adoc[RPM lockfiles] containing RPMs that require subscription, you have to include additional labels and annotations so that the xref:ROOT:mintmaker:user.adoc[Dependency Management] service can properly match the activation keys with their repositories. How to create such secrets is explained in the next section.
* The default secret `+activation-key+` doesn't have such requirements and will be automatically used as a fallback option for all namespace components.
* Besides correctly setting the secret labels, additional configuration must be performed, as described in xref:ROOT:mintmaker:rpm-lockfile.adoc#rpm-lockfile-with-rpms-that-require-subscription[RPM lockfile with RPMs that require subscription]
====

== Create the activation key secrets

[[Create-activation-key-through-the-UI]]
=== Create activation key secret through the UI

. Access the Secrets section in the konflux UI and click on *Add secret*.
. Set the secret name to activation-key.
. Add the first key with the name *org* and and set the value to your org id.
. Add a second key with the name *activationkey* and set the value to the name of your activation key.
. Save the secret by clicking *Add secret*

[[Create-activation-key-through-console]]
=== Create activation key secret through console

Alternatively, you can create the secret through the CLI. After logging into your cluster and navigating to your namespace, run the following command:

----
kubectl create secret generic activation-key -n <your-tenant> --from-literal=org=<your org id> --from-literal=activationkey=<your activation key name>
----

[[Create-custom-activation-key-secret]]
=== Create custom activation key secret
Create custom activation key secrets with extra labels and annotations so that they can be matched to their repositories.
[NOTE]
====
* This procedure is only necessary if you want to have your RPM lockfiles automatically updated by MintMaker. Otherwise, you can create your custom secrets without the extra labels and annotations.
* The default `+activation-key+` secret doesn't need to follow this procedure, it will be applied to all namespaces repositories as a fallback option.
* Additional configuration must be performed, as described in xref:ROOT:mintmaker:rpm-lockfile.adoc#rpm-lockfile-with-rpms-that-require-subscription[RPM lockfile with RPMs that require subscription]
====
These secrets can only be created through the CLI:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl create -f activation-key-secret.yaml
----

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: custom-activation-key
  namespace: <YOUR NAMESPACE>
  labels:
    appstudio.redhat.com/credentials: rpm
    appstudio.redhat.com/scm.host: <source-control-management-host> # for example, gitlab.com
type: Opaque
stringData:
  org: <YOUR ORG ID>
  activationkey: <YOUR ACTIVATION KEY>
----
This secret will be matched to all repositories with the same Git host. If you want to narrow the matching to specific repositories, you have to add the `appstudio.redhat.com/scm.repository` annotation to the secret metadata:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: custom-activation-key
  namespace: <YOUR NAMESPACE>
  labels:
    appstudio.redhat.com/credentials: rpm
    appstudio.redhat.com/scm.host: <source-control-management-host> # for example, gitlab.com
  annotations:
    appstudio.redhat.com/scm.repository: my-user/*
type: Opaque
stringData:
  org: <YOUR ORG ID>
  activationkey: <YOUR ACTIVATION KEY>
----

This annotation will match the secret to all repositories in `my-user` organization. If you want to match the secret to a specific repository, the annotation should be defined as such:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: custom-activation-key
  namespace: <YOUR NAMESPACE>
  labels:
    appstudio.redhat.com/credentials: rpm
    appstudio.redhat.com/scm.host: <source-control-management-host> # for example, gitlab.com
  annotations:
    appstudio.redhat.com/scm.repository: my-user/my-repository
type: Opaque
stringData:
  org: <YOUR ORG ID>
  activationkey: <YOUR ACTIVATION KEY>
----
Multiple repositories can be listed under the `appstudio.redhat.com/scm.repository` annotation. Separate repository names with commas when listing them. The secret will be used for all repositories that match the specified paths.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Secrets lookup mechanism is searching for the most specific secret first. The secret with a repository annotation will be used first if it matches the component repository path. In none found, then a lookup will try to find a secret with a wildcard, or just the host matching one. As a fallback, the lookup will use the default `+activation-key+` secret.
====

== Using subscription content in a build

=== Non-hermetic (network connected) builds:

==== Automatic registration

The buildah task will use a provided activation key to register itself with Red Hat subscription manager and mount the necessary certificates to the build environment. Simply add `+dnf+` or `+yum install+` commands to your Containerfile. 

TIP: If your activation key includes more than the default repositories, add the following command inside your Containerfile in order update repository metadata:

----
subscription-manager refresh
----

==== Explicit registration

If you include a `+subscription-manager register+`  command in your Containerfile, automatic registration will be disabled. You can control subscription-manager directly using the normal commands.

=== Hermetic (network isolated) builds:

The prefetch-dependencies task can use an activation key to register and fetch RPMs. All repositories configured for the activation key will be enabled for prefetch. 
If the default name was used for the secret (activation-key) no configuration is necessary. Otherwise, provide the ACTIVATION_KEY parameter to the build pipeline as noted above.

=== Configuring an RPM lockfile for hermetic builds

The `+rpm-lockfile-prototype+` tool uses live dnf metadata to resolve a given `+rpms.in.yaml+` file into an `+rpms.lock.yaml+` file in which every RPM is pinned to a repository and version. Because it uses live metadata, the configuration of package repositories on the system will influence the results.

Let's explore a simple scenario that should illustrate all pertinent parts of the process.

We will create a lockfile that includes the `+openshift-clients+` RPM which:

* requires a subscription to the OpenShift product
* is not located in the default Red Hat Enterprise Linux repositories
* is available for multiple architectures

This RPM is available in the following repositories:

[cols="2,1"]
|===
|*architecture* |*repository*
|x86_64 |rhocp-4.17-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms
|aarch64 |rhocp-4.17-for-rhel-9-aarch64-rpms
|===

==== Create the activation key

===== Create a new activation key
Navigate to https://console.redhat.com/insights/connector/activation-keys and create a new activation key. Follow the instructions in the wizard. 

Refer to the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/subscription_central/1-latest/html/getting_started_with_activation_keys_on_the_hybrid_cloud_console/index[Red Hat documentation] for additional information.

===== Add additional repositories to the key
Once the key is created, click "add repositories". Add all the applicable repositories for all architectures. If you want to build source containers include the corresponding source repositories as well.

.Selecting additional repositories for an activation key
image::activation-key-choose-repos.png[redhat-activation-key-configuration]

When saved, your key should look something like this:

.Activation Key with additional repositories configured
image::activation-key-additional-repos-view.png[redhat-activation-key-additional-repositories]

IMPORTANT: Note the *name* of the activation key and the *org ID* which can be found in the drop-down under your name in the top right corner of the screen. You will need both in a subsequent step to register the container using `+subscription-manager+`.

==== Configure rpm-lockfile-prototype

NOTE: For this step we will assume that you have source code in your current working directory `+$(pwd)+`.

1. Start a new container using the same version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux as what you will be building on and mount your source code directory:

In this example, we'll using the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Universal Base Image (UBI 9).

----
podman run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/source:Z registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9
----

[start=2]
. Register with your activation key from the previous step:

----
subscription-manager register --activationkey="$KEY_NAME" --org="$ORG_ID"
----

IMPORTANT: You may see a message saying `+subscription-manager is operating in
container mode. Use your host system to manage subscriptions.+`, which is not
applicable if you're running the container on Fedora or MacOS.

[start=3]
. Verify that you have the correct repositories and enable missing source repositories.
NOTE: It is normal to only see the repositories for your current architecture at this stage.

----

In the example above, the source RPM repositories are not enabled for the following repositories:

----
ubi-9-appstream-rpms                                                                                                           
ubi-9-baseos-rpms

. Configure `+rpms.in.yaml+`
There are three things to configure:
.. Add `./redhat.repo` under `contentOrigin.repofiles` in `+rpms.in.yaml+`
.. Add the RPM we want Konflux to prefetch for hermetic builds (`+openshift-clients+`)
.. Configure the enabled architectures

The following is an example of what your `+rpms.in.yaml+` file should look like:

----                                                                                                                            
contentOrigin:
  # Define at least one source of packages, but you can have as many as you want.
  repofiles:
     - ./redhat.repo

packages:
  # list of rpm names to resolve
  - openshift-clients

#reinstallPackages: []
  # list of rpms already provided in the base image, but which should be
  # reinstalled

arches:
  # The list of architectures can be set in the config file. Any `--arch` option set
  # on the command line will override this list.
  - aarch64
  - x86_64
  # - s390x
  # - ppc64le

context:
    # Alternative to setting command line options. Usually you will only want
    # to include one of these options, with the exception of `flatpak` that
    # can be combined with `image` and `containerfile` 
    containerfile: Containerfile
----

NOTE: In the source directory for this example there is a Containerfile named `+Containerfile+` which starts with the line `FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi`, which is the reason why we're using a RHEL 9 UBI image to generate the lock file.

[start=9]
. Create the lock file
----
cd /source; rpm-lockfile-prototype -f Containerfile rpms.in.yaml
----

If you encounter SSL errors (`+Problem with the local SSL certificates+`), make
sure the `+sslclientkey+` and `+sslclientcert+` options in `+redhat.repo+`
resolve to the correct path on the file system. These options point to
certificates and keys that use a unique identifier (e.g., `+sslclientcert =
/etc/pki/entitlement-host/$ID.pem+`). You may see SSL issues if you copied a
repository configuration file from a different system registered with a
different entitlement or activation key. Alternatively, these options can be set by using the `DNF_VAR_SSL_CLIENT_KEY` and `DNF_VAR_SSL_CLIENT_CERT` environment variables.

If successful, you should see a `+rpms.lock.yaml+` file in the source directory:

----
---
lockfileVersion: 1
lockfileVendor: redhat
arches:
- arch: x86_64
  packages:
  - url: https://cdn.redhat.com/content/dist/layered/rhel9/x86_64/rhocp/4.16/os/Packages/o/openshift-clients-4.16.0-202410172045.p0.gcf533b5.assembly.stream.el9.x86_64.rpm

    sourcerpm: openshift-clients-4.16.0-202410172045.p0.gcf533b5.assembly.stream.el9.src.rpm
...
----

TIP: If you see warnings like "`+WARNING:root:No sources found for...+`" then there is a source repository that still needs to be enabled in your repository configuration. If so, and you need source RPMs, be sure to enable the source RPM repositories in `+redhat.repo+` and regenerate the lock file.

[start=10]
Finally, commit the `+rpms.in.yaml+`, `+rpms.lock.yaml+` and `+redhat.repo+` to
source control. Konflux will use these files to prefetch RPMs for hermetic
builds.
