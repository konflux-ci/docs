= Building Binaries in {ProductName}

This guide provides guidelines on how to build binaries within {ProductName}.

== Theory

The fundamental process involves creating a Containerfile to encapsulate your binary build process, similar to the production of container images. This allows you to define applications and components in {ProductName} as you xref:applications-components/creating.adoc[normally would].

If you're unfamiliar with Containerfiles, consult the official link:https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/[Dockerfile documentation].

== Example

Let's assume you have a shell script named `build-binary.sh` in your repository that compiles your binary. A basic Containerfile would resemble this:

include::partial${context}-example-binary-dockerfile.adoc[]

include::partial${context}-releasing-considerations.adoc[]

== Other Considerations

If you want to use xref:hermetic-builds.adoc[hermetic builds], ensure you've pre-fetched all dependencies as described in xref:prefetching-dependencies.adoc[prefetching dependencies]. This ensures that your builds are reproducible and isolated.
