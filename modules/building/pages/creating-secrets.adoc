= Creating secrets for your builds

When you build your pipeline, you might want to add tasks that require **secrets** in order to access external resources.

Secrets can be categorized depending on when they need to be added.

. Before a component is added. If a secret is needed to access the source control platform like xref:building:creating-secrets.adoc#creating-source-control-secrets[GitLab], you must create a secret before you create the component.
. Before a build succeeds. Some artifact build tasks need specific secrets to be able to pull all of the content to include in the final artifact. For example, you can add secrets for xref:building:creating-secrets.adoc#creating-registry-pull-secrets[container registries] after you create the component but they must be provided before a successful build can occur.
. After a component has been onboarded. These secrets are often used in tasks. The tasks included in the {ProductName} pipelines will not fail if a secret is not created properly. Instead, the task will just not run the code like with xref:building:creating-secrets.adoc#creating-task-input-secrets[snyk].

== Creating task input secrets

Sometimes to run the tasks properly, you may need to pass secrets to these tasks. Consult the documentation for these tasks to understand the proper specification of the secrets required, for example the required keys/values.

NOTE: One such task is the link:https://github.com/konflux-ci/build-definitions/tree/main/task/sast-snyk-check[sast-snyk-check] task that uses the third-party service link:https://snyk.io/[snyk] to perform static application security testing (SAST) as a part of the default {ProductName} pipeline. Use this procedure to upload your snyk.io token. Name the secret `snyk-secret` and use the key `snyk_token` so that the snyk task in the {ProductName} pipeline will be able to access and use the token.

.Procedure

. In {ProductName}, from the left navigation menu, select **Secrets**.
. From the **Secrets** page, click **Add secret**.
. For **Secret type**, select **Key/value secret**
. For **Secret name**, enter a unique name for your secret.
. Under **Key/value secret**, expand **Key/value 1**, then enter a key.
. For **Upload the file with value for your key or paste its contents**, do one of the following:
    * Click **Upload** to browse to, select, and upload the file that contains your key value.
    * Drag the file that contains your key value into the space under **Upload**.
    * Paste the contents of the file that contains your key value into the space under **Upload**.
  Click **Clear** to remove the contents of the space under **Upload**.
. Optional: Click **Add another key/value**.
. Optional: Under **Labels**, add a label to tag or provide more context for your secret.
. Click **Add secret**.

[#creating-registry-pull-secrets]
== Creating registry pull secrets

Some container builds may use parent images from registries that require authentication, for example, `registry.redhat.io`. Until these credentials have been configured, the builds will continue to fail due to the system being unable to pull the required images.

.Procedure

. Obtain the username and password login credentials for the container registry.
    * For access to `registry.redhat.io`, you can create a registry service account at https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/accounts.
. In the correct {ProductName} tenant namespace, go to **Secrets**. 
. Click **Add secret**.  
. For **Secret type**, select **Image pull secret**.
. For **Authentication type**, select **Image registry credentials**.
. For **Registry server address** enter the image registry (for example `registry.redhat.io`).
. Enter the username for the registry in **Username**.
. Enter the password for the registry in **Password**.
. Click **Add secret**.

=== Example of creating a quay.io secret

. Login to {ProductName} console your tenant namespace
. Click on `Secrets` on the left menu.
. Click on `Add Secret`
. Choose `Image pull secret` for `Secret type`
. Enter `Secret name` , for example `my-quay-secret`
. From `Link secret options` select either `All existing and future components in the namespace` or
  `Select components in the namespace` and specify components
. Choose `Image registry credentials` in `Authentication type` field
. Enter `quay.io/repository_full_path` in `Registry server address` (specify full repository path, eg. quay.io/test_organization/test-repository)
. Enter your Quay.io username in `Username`
. Enter your Quay.io API token in `Password` field.
. Click on `Add secret`
. Email is optional


Here is the YAML representation of the secret (for reference):

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
.dockerconfigjson: <base64-encoded-credentials>
kind: Secret
metadata:
name: my-quay-secret
namespace: <your-tenant>
type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
----


[NOTE]
====
* **Secret Linking via UI**
  The {ProductName} UI links image pull secrets to either selected or all components
    specific service accounts `build-pipeline-$COMPONENT_NAME`
  - No pipeline YAML changes are required.
  - Tasks like the buildah task will use this secret automatically when pulling images from `quay.io`. (https://github.com/konflux-ci/build-definitions/blob/main/task/buildah-oci-ta/0.3/buildah-oci-ta.yaml in volumes)

* **Manual Secret Creation**
  . **Link Secret To SA**
    - If you create the secret manually (e.g., via `kubectl` or YAML), you must **manually link it**
      to the component specific `build-pipeline-$COMPONENT_NAME` ServiceAccount in your namespace.
    - If you want to manually create shared secret which will be then linked to all newly
      onboarded component specific ServiceAccounts,
      add to the secret label: **build.appstudio.openshift.io/common-secret: 'true'**.
      It is the same as what UI is doing when selecting Link secret option with
      All existing and future components in the namespace.

  . **Secrets Via Tenant Namespace**
    - Explicitly mount secrets as files using a tenant namespace
    - RBAC: Ensure the ServiceAccount has permission to access the secret (via Role/RoleBinding).

  . **Secrets as Environment Variables**
    - Inject secrets into environment variables
    - RBAC: The ServiceAccount must have `get` permission for the secret.

* **Troubleshooting**
  For issues with secret linking, review the xref:troubleshooting:registries.adoc#check-if-the-secret-is-linked-to-the-service-account[troubleshooting section].

[#gitlab-source-secret]
== Creating GitLab source control secrets

[NOTE]
====
When building content from GitHub, you will need to install an application for Pipelines as a Code in your repository.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have completed the steps listed in the xref:ROOT:getting-started.adoc#getting-started-with-the-cli[Getting started in the CLI] page.

.Procedure

. In GitLab click on Settings -> Access Tokens on the left menu of your repository.
+
NOTE: if you don't see this option, you need someone with permissions to do so.
. Then click on `Add new token`.
. If your GitLab instance supports setting token roles, set the role to `Maintainer`.
. Select the following scopes: `api`, `read_repository`, and `write_repository`.
. Select **Create project access token**.
. Add a token to your {ProductName} tenant namespace by running the `kubectl create` command and creating a new YAML file with a secret:

+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl create -f GL-secret.yaml
----

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: pipelines-as-code-secret
  namespace: <YOUR NAMESPACE>
  labels:
    appstudio.redhat.com/credentials: scm
    appstudio.redhat.com/scm.host: <source-control-management-host> # for example, gitlab.com
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
stringData:
  password: <PROJECT ACCESS TOKEN>
----

+
[NOTE]
====
Using the PAT authentication requires only the `password` key. The `username` should not be set. If you set both the `username` and `password` keys, the authentication type will be considered as `basic`, and a basic authentication client will be created using those credentials. This client might not work or can be considered as a deprecated login method by some Source Code Management (SCM) providers.
====

This secret will be used by the build service to perform builds with Pipeline-as-Code.

This Project Access Tokens are scoped to a project, so you cannot use them to access resources from other projects. For more information regarding Project Access Tokens, see the Gitlab https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html[documentation].

It is also possible to have secrets for per-repository or organization access. To do this, a `appstudio.redhat.com/scm.repository` annotation should be added to the secret. It may either specify the full repository path or the partial path with a wildcard. For example, to create a secret for all repositories in the `my-user` organization, create (or add) the following YAML file:


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: pipelines-as-code-secret
  namespace: <YOUR NAMESPACE>
  labels:
    appstudio.redhat.com/credentials: scm
    appstudio.redhat.com/scm.host: <source-control-management-host> # for example, gitlab.com
  annotations:
    appstudio.redhat.com/scm.repository: my-user/*
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
stringData:
  password: <PROJECT ACCESS TOKEN>
----

For a specific repository, the following secret should be created:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: pipelines-as-code-secret
  namespace: <YOUR NAMESPACE>
  labels:
    appstudio.redhat.com/credentials: scm
    appstudio.redhat.com/scm.host: <source-control-management-host> # for example, gitlab.com
  annotations:
    appstudio.redhat.com/scm.repository: <repository-path> # for example, my-user/my-repo
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
stringData:
  password: <PROJECT ACCESS TOKEN>
----

[NOTE]
====
* You can have multiple repositories listed under the `appstudio.redhat.com/scm.repository` annotation. Separate repository names with commas when listing them. The secret will be used for all repositories that match the specified paths.

* You can also have multiple secrets with different labels and/or annotations. In order to work, at least the additional ones, need to be named with `pipeline-as-code-secret` as prefix (for example pipeline-as-code-secret-xxx).
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Secrets lookup mechanism is searching for the most specific secret first. The secret with a repository annotation will be used first if it matches the component repository path. In none found, then a lookup will try to find a secret with a wildcard, or just the host matching one.

* If you upload a GitLab access token to a tenant namespace, {ProductName} won’t use the global GitHub application when accessing GitHub repositories.

* If your GitLab project uses restrictive link:https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/push_rules.html[push rules] to verify users, Konflux may fail to push commits to your repository.
====

== Referencing Secrets in a Containerfile

Sometimes you might need to reference a secret directly in your Containerfile. For example, if your build uses cryptographic parameters stored in secrets, you can use the link:https://github.com/konflux-ci/build-definitions/blob/main/task/buildah-oci-ta/0.4/README.md[`ADDITIONAL_SECRET` parameter] to customize encryption in your Containerfile.

.Procedure

. Create the secret (see <<creating-task-input-secrets>>). In this example, we create a secret with SALT and KEY_HASH keys:
+
[subs="+quotes",yaml]
----
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: _<your_secret_name>_
  namespace: _<your_workspace_tenant>_
data:
  SALT: 11111111111
  KEY_HASH: 11111111111
type: Opaque
----

. In the build-container task of your Tekton pipeline, set the value of the `ADDITIONAL_SECRET` parameter to _<your_secret_name>_:
+
[subs="+quotes",yaml]
----
# ...
  tasks:
    - name: build-container
      params:
        - name: ADDITIONAL_SECRET
          value: _<your_secret_name>_
# ...
----

. In the Containerfile, use a `RUN` command to mount the secret. In this example, we export the content of the mounted files as environment variables for `cargo build`:
+
[subs="+quotes",dockerfile]
----
# Build with secrets
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=_<your_secret_name>_/SALT \
    --mount=type=secret,id=_<your_secret_name>_/KEY_HASH \
    export SALT="$(cat /run/secrets/_<your_secret_name>_/SALT)" && \
    export KEY_HASH="$(cat /run/secrets/_<your_secret_name>_/KEY_HASH)" && \
    cargo build --release
----

[NOTE]
====
Only `RUN` commands are able to reference secrets.
