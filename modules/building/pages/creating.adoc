= Creating applications and components

Create applications and components using the {ProductName} UI or `kubectl`.

== Creating an application

An application is a logical grouping of components that are developed and deployed together.

=== With the UI

.Prerequisites:

* xref:installing:enabling-builds.adoc[Enabled] build pipelines for your instance of {ProductName}.
* xref:installing:enabling-builds.adoc#enable-image-controller[Enabled] image controller for your instance of {ProductName}.

.*Procedures*

. In the {ProductName} UI, go to the *Applications* page.
. Click the *Create application* button.
. Enter a name for the application.
. Click *Create application*.

=== With the CLI

.Prerequisites:

* xref:installing:enabling-builds.adoc[Enabled] build pipelines for your instance of {ProductName}.
* link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/[kubectl] CLI tool
* Completed the steps listed in the xref:ROOT:getting-started.adoc#getting-started-with-the-cli[Getting started with the CLI] page.

.*Procedures*

. Create an `Application.yaml` file locally.

+
.Example `Application.yaml` object
include::partial$custom-resources/{context}-application.adoc[]

. Apply the resource to your namespace by running the following command:

+
[source,shell]
----
$ kubectl apply -f Application.yaml
----

+
NOTE: You can create additional applications by adding their custom resource configurations to the `Application.yaml` file.

== Creating components

A component is an individual part of an application that contains source code and a build configuration.

Before onboarding a component to {ProductName}, ensure that the instance has appropriate access to the git repository. This means either installing your organization's {ProductName} GitHub App on the source code repository or xref:building:creating-secrets.adoc#creating-source-control-secrets[creating a secret] to enable access to a GitLab repository.

NOTE: Component names must be unique in a namespace, even when components are used in different applications.

CAUTION: {ProductName} pushes directly to branches in your onboarded repositories. In order to properly onboard, ensure
that no rules prevent pushes to the branch patterns *`konflux-*`* and *`konflux/mintmaker/*`*.

=== With the UI

.Prerequisites:

* xref:installing:enabling-builds.adoc[Enabled] build pipelines for your instance of {ProductName}.
* xref:installing:enabling-builds.adoc#enable-image-controller[Enabled] image controller for your instance of {ProductName}.
* An existing application in your namespace.

.*Procedures*

. In the {ProductName} UI, go to the *Applications* page.
. Click on the name of the application that you want to add a component to.
. Click on *Actions* and *Add component*.
+
NOTE: For *Gitlab* provider, make sure to xref:building:creating-secrets.adoc#creating-source-control-secrets[create a source control secret] before creating the component.
  . Enter the URL for the git repository.
  . (Optional) After clicking out of the repository URL, expand the *Show advanced Git options*.
    . Enter the branch name to the *Git reference* dialogue.
    . Enter the path to the context directory if the build context is contained somewhere other than the repository root.
  . Enter the path to the Dockerfile within the git repository. This will be the path within the context directory.
  . (Optional) Change the component name if desired.
  . (Optional) Click on the *Pipeline* drop down box and select the desired pipeline to configure your component with.
  . (Optional) Click on *Add secret* to add a secret which will be needed for the component build. See xref:building:creating-secrets.adoc[creating secrets] for more information.
. Click *Add component*.

+
NOTE: GitHub and GitLab are supported source control providers. GitLab support requires the configuration of xref:building:creating-secrets.adoc#creating-source-control-secrets[source control secrets].

NOTE: When Component is immediately removed after creation it might result with orphaned ImageRepository which ownership
wasn't yet assigned to the Component and when trying to create Component again with the same name UI will
complain with error that ImageRepository already exists, solution is to remove manually ImageRepository
from OCP.

=== With the CLI

.Prerequisites:

* xref:installing:enabling-builds.adoc[Enabled] build pipelines for your instance of {ProductName}.
* link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/[kubectl] CLI tool
* You have completed the steps listed in the xref:ROOT:getting-started.adoc#getting-started-with-the-cli[Getting started with the CLI] page.
* An existing application in your namespace.

.*Procedures*

. Create a `Component.yaml` and `ImageRepository.yaml` file locally.

+
.Example `Component.yaml` object
include::partial$custom-resources/{context}-component.adoc[]

+
NOTE: Request annotation 'build.appstudio.openshift.io/request' can be set also to 'configure-pac-no-mr' and
then during onboarding the onboarding PR won't be created and users will have to create pipeline run yaml
files for the component manually.

+
.Example `ImageRepository.yaml` object
include::partial$custom-resources/{context}-imagerepository.adoc[]

. Apply the resources to your namespace by running the following command:

+
[source,shell]
----
$ kubectl apply -f Component.yaml -f ImageRepository.yaml
----

+
NOTE: You can create additional components by adding their custom resource configurations to the YAML files.

. Configure the build pipeline for your component:
.. If the annotation `build.appstudio.openshift.io/request: configure-pac` is set on the component, {ProductName} automatically creates a pull request or merge request in your repository with the Tekton pipeline definitions. Review and merge this pull request to complete the setup.
.. If the annotation is not set or is set to `configure-pac-no-mr`, manually create or update the Tekton pipeline files in your repository.

+
NOTE: The PipelineRun will run only for submitters who have permission to run PipelineRuns or who receive an `/ok-to-test` comment from an authorized user. +
For further details on PipelineRun permissions, please refer to the https://pipelinesascode.com/docs/guide/running/[PipelinesAsCode documentation].

. Once the PR is made, a build pipeline should start. Track its progress in the {ProductName} UI or see the final status in GitHub after the pipeline completes. If the pipeline is successful, merge the PR.

== Using different from default image repository

When using ImageRepository object, you will end up with image repository in
a default organization, if you want to use your own repository
don't create ImageRepository and follow this section.

Create your own repository in quay.io (or other registry, our example will be for quay.io)

In quay.io web UI, go to your organization and click on *Create New Repository*, enter repository name
and visibility and click on *Create Public/Private Repository* button.
eg. `quay.io/test_organization/own-repository`

Create robot account in your organization and grant write permission to your repository,
you can also create another robot account only with read permissions.

In quay.io web UI, go to your organization, click on *Robot Accounts* in the left menu,
then click on *Create Robot Account*, enter name of robot account and click on *Create robot account* button,
in the list of repos find your repository and set *write* permission for it and then click on *Add permissions* button.

When you click on the newly created robot account on *Robot Accounts* page, you can get details of the account.
In the openened popup for the account first you will see credentials *Username* and *Token* (we will use them later),
when you click on *Kubernetes Secret* you can download secret yml file (we will use it later).

Now we will have to create secret with repository credentials.

=== Creating Secret via {ProductName} UI
You can now xref:building:creating-secrets.adoc#example-of-creating-a-quay-io-secret[create a secret]
with the credentials above.
Make sure to use the most narrowly valid scope for the `registry server address` field
when adding the secret.

When adding the secret (image registry) with the UI, you will have to choose components to which component specific
service accounts `build-pipeline-$COMPONENT_NAME` secret will be linked to,
so that it can be leveraged by builds.

=== Creating Secret manually

If you aren't using quay.io registry and have only login & password, you will have to podman login
with credentials, and then get docker config json from  `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json` base64 encode it
and add to the secret.

Download secret yml for your robot account (from *Robot Accounts* page described above)
and save it as `Secret.yaml`.

It will look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: secret-name
data:
  .dockerconfigjson: <base64-encoded-credentials>
type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
----

Edit the file and add `metadata.namespace` with value of your namespace: `<your-tenant>`

Encoded credentials from quay.io will be by default for `quay.io` repository, unless you are using only custom repository
for whole namespace, with robot account for all repos and will have only one secret in the namespace for registry,
you will have to change the repository in the encoded credentials
from `quay.io` to `quay.io/test_organization/own-repository`.

To get new <base64-encoded-credentials> follow these steps:

Decode encoded credentials save them to file : `echo <base64-encoded-credentials> | base64 -d > auth.json`

file will look like

[source,json]
----
{
  "auths": {
    "quay.io": {
      "auth": "<base64-encoded-auth>",
      "email": ""
    }
  }
}
----

Edit file and change `quay.io` to full repository name `quay.io/test_organization/own-repository`.

Encode credentials again: `cat auth.json | base64 -w0`
and change `<base64-encoded-credentials>` to newly generated credentials in `Secret.yaml`.


And create the secret:

[source,shell]
----
$ kubectl apply -f Secret.yaml
----

Now we will have to also link the secret to the component specific service account `build-pipeline-$COMPONENT_NAME`,
edit service account either with OCP UI or Cli and to the `secrets` section of the service account
add your newly created secret, service account should look like:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: ServiceAccount
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: build-pipeline-$COMPONENT_NAME
  namespace: <your-tenant>
secrets:
  - name: secret-name
----

=== Creating component which will be using your own repository

Now that we have create secret with credential to our own repository,
we can finally create component using it.
Follow examples above about how to create Component via Cli,
but now you will have to set `spec.containerImage` to your own repository `quay.io/test_organization/own-repository`.


== Finding the built images

After a pipeline completes with a built artifact, you may want to test the resulting image to ensure that it works properly. The `IMAGE_URL` Tekton result (discoverable from the UI or CLI) should be set to the pullspec for the image.

NOTE: {ProductName} automatically deletes images built for PR pipelines five days after building them.

=== With the UI

All build PipelineRuns are visible in the {ProductName} UI. The location of these images in the OCI registry is reported on the *Activity* page.

.Procedure

In the console, complete the following steps to find the image pullspec for a completed PipelineRun:

. Navigate to the *Activity* > *Pipeline runs* tab.

. For the component whose SBOM you want to view, select its most recent pipeline run.

. Find the *Results* section at the bottom of the page and look for the `IMAGE_URL` row. It should resemble `quay.io/redhat-user-workloads/your-tenant/application/component:tag`. You can use the `IMAGE_DIGEST` provided as an alternate mechanism for referencing the image.

=== With the CLI

After the build PipelineRuns are completed from git push events, the Components are updated with the location of the artifact in the OCI registry.


.Prerequisites

* xref:ROOT:getting-started.adoc#getting-started-with-the-cli[Login] to {ProductName}.

* Install the link:https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/[jq] CLI tool.

.Procedure

In the CLI, complete the following steps to find the latest pullspec for a component:

. List your components.
+
[source]
----
$ kubectl get components
----
+
.Example output
+
[source]
----
NAME                               AGE   STATUS   REASON   TYPE
devfile-sample-go-basic-8wqt       8m54s True     OK       Updated
devfile-sample-python-basic-ikch   20d   True     OK       Updated
----

. Choose which component's image you want to discover. Then use `kubectl get` and the `jq` CLI tool to get the component image path.

+
[source]
----
$ kubectl get component <component name> -o json | jq '.status.containerImage'
----

. For convenience, you may want to save the image path to a local variable.
+
Example:
+
[source]
--
IMAGE=quay.io/redhat-user-workloads/your-tenant/application/component@sha256:<output omitted>
--
