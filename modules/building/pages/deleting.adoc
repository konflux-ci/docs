= Deleting applications and components

You can delete a component or application if you are a user with the {ProductName} admin role.

WARNING: If you delete a component permanently, you delete all resources from the quay organization, user interface (UI), and upstream repositories. This includes all images that have been previously built by {ProductName} that haven't been copied into a different location, Tekton pipeline definitions, and other resources managed in those repositories. The deletion process submits a pull request (PR) to remove these pipeline definitions and associated resources.

WARNING: If you delete a component then any previous snapshots referencing this component will become invalid since the image reference will no longer be valid.

WARNING: If you delete an application permanently, you delete all the components within that application and all resources linked to these components.
