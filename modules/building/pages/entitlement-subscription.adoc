= Using Red Hat entitlement subscription

WARNING: This page has been superceded by xref:./activation-keys-subscription.adoc[Using Red Hat activation keys to access subscription content]. While the instructions here still work, this method is discouraged by Red Hat and users are advised that subscription entitlement certificates may be revoked as part of normal operations. Under normal circumstances this is intentional and managed by subscription-manager in order to refresh entitlement data, but with these instructions it will result in build failures and require manual user intervention.


Entitlement subscription allows users to install RPMs that are not accessible without it. In order to use it in your builds, you must have access to an entitlement subscription 
and possess the neccessary entitlement certificate files. To obtain them, review https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/01/24/create-entitled-builds-red-hat-subscriptions-openshift[Subscription benefits for secure deployments] guide.

Once you have the *<entitlement-id>.pem* and *<entitlement-id>-key.pem* files, you will need to create a secret in your Konflux namespace. You can do it in two ways:

. <<Create-entitlement-secret-through-the-UI>>
. <<Create-entitlement-secret-through-console>>


[[Create-entitlement-secret-through-the-UI]]
== Create entitlement secret through the UI

1. Access the Secrets section in the konflux UI and click on *Add secret*.
2. Set the secret name to *etc-pki-entitlement*.
3. Add the first key with the name *<entitlement-id>-key.pem* and and set the value to the contents of the key file.
4. Add a second key with the name *<entitlement-id>.pem* and set the value to the contents of the certificate file.
5. Save the secret by clicking *Add secret*

[[Create-entitlement-secret-through-console]]
== Create entitlement secret through console

Alternatively, you can create the secret through the CLI. After logging into your cluster and navigating to your namespace, run the following command:

----
kubectl create secret generic etc-pki-entitlement -n <your-tenant> --from-file <entitlement-id>-key.pem --from-file <entitlement-id>.pem
----
