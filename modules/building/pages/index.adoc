= Configuring your builds

When creating a component, {ProductName} will push a Tekton PipelineRun to your component's source repository. This pipeline is yours to customize as needed for building your component and Tekton Chains will record the customizations in a detailed signed in-toto provenance attestation. This provenance enables Enterprise Contract to xref:managing-compliance-with-ec:index.adoc[manage compliance] to ensure the artifact's integrity and compliance with specific policies.

== Additional resources [[additional-resources]]

* The sample pipelines that you can initially configure your components with depend on the {ProductName} deployment. This might include the pipelines provided by xref:installing:enabling-builds.adoc#available-pipelines[{ProductName}] or other additional pipelines.
* If you want to change the configured pipeline for your component after it is onboarded, see xref:building:reconfiguring-build-pipeline.adoc#changing-pipelines[reconfiguring the build pipeline].
* Since the Tekton PipelineRuns use link:https://pipelinesascode.com[Pipelines as Code] to trigger the jobs on the cluster, you can also use any of the link:https://pipelinesascode.com/docs/guide/authoringprs/#default-parameters[default parameters] in the PipelineRuns in your git repositories.
