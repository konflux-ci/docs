= Reconfiguring the build pipeline

After you have created a component {ProductName}, you may find yourself in a situation where you want to reset your build pipeline to the latest version. For instance:

* If you have xref:./customizing-the-build.adoc[made changes to your build pipeline] and the pipeline no longer works.
* You discover that a new pipeline is available that you want to change to.
* You cannot figure out how to update your build pipeline to resolve breaking changes in the task updates.

.*Prerequisites*

* You have an existing Development tenant namespace.
* You have completed the steps listed in the xref:ROOT:getting-started.adoc#getting-started-with-the-cli[Getting started in the CLI] page.

+
.Example output
+
[source]
----
NAME                               AGE   STATUS   REASON   TYPE
devfile-sample-go-basic-8wqt       8m54s True     OK       Updated
devfile-sample-python-basic-ikch   20d   True     OK       Updated
----

. Choose which component you want to reset.

+
[source]
----
$ kubectl edit component <component name>
----

.. While editing the component, add the request to `metadata.annotations`.

+
[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  annotations:

WARNING: {ProductName} will submit a pull request to reset the Tekton pipeline in your git repository which will not have any previous customizations included. If you made changes that you want to preserve, you will need to re-apply these changes.
