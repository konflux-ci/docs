{ProductName} does not provide direct support for external vault solutions. However, administrators can install third-party operators to enable integration with external secret management systems.

One commonly used solution is the link:https://external-secrets.io[External Secrets Operator], which synchronizes secrets from external vaults into Kubernetes secrets that {ProductName} can use.

To determine which external vault solutions are available in your {ProductName} instance, contact your local {ProductName} administrators. They can provide information about:

* Which vault integrations are installed and configured
* How to access and use external vaults in your namespace
* Authentication requirements and permissions
* Best practices for your specific {ProductName} deployment
