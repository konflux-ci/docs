= Customizing Policy

A Conforma Policy defines which checks are performed by Conforma during integration tests and
release. If Conforma reports violations, the best course of action, in most cases, is to adjust the build
process to remedy the violation. For example, if Conforma reports that a certain required scanner was not
executed, add the scanner to your build pipeline. Read the text associated with the violation as
that often provides context-specific information to help remedy violations.

However, there are times where remedying the violation is not an option. In this case, customizing
the Policy is the only option to waive the failing check.

* xref:compliance:policy-evaluations.adoc[Identify] which Policy
is being used to verify the Components in your Application.
* Determine if this is a Policy you can modify. Policies are often shared between different users.
Adding an exception to a shared Policy may not be in the best interest of all users. Creating a new
Policy for your particular use case may be a better approach. You can copy an existing Policy as a
starting point.
* Update your Policy to exclude a certain violation. See the
link:https://conforma.dev/docs/cli/configuration.html[Policy Configuration] docs
for details and examples.
* Update your xref:testing:integration/editing.adoc[integration tests] and the
xref:releasing:create-release-plan-admission.adoc[ReleasePlanAdmission] to use the
new Policy.
* If needed, re-run the xref:testing:integration/rerunning.adoc[integration tests] or
xref:releasing:create-release.adoc[release].
