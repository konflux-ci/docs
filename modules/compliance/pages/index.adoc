= Managing compliance with Conforma

Conforma is an artifact verifier and customizable policy checker. By default, {ProductName} adds Conforma as an integration test to each new application. Conforma then keeps your software supply chain secure and ensures container images comply with your organization's policies. It does this by verifying the security and provenance of builds created through {ProductName}.

{ProductName}'s build process uses Tekton Chains to produce a signed in-toto provenance attestation of the build pipeline. Conforma then uses this attestation to verify the build's integrity and compliance with a set of policies. These policies include best practices and any organization-specific requirements.

If you ever need to restore the default EC integration test to an application, or if you want to use a different configuration of the EC as an integration test, see our xref:testing:integration/adding.adoc[Adding an integration test] guide.
