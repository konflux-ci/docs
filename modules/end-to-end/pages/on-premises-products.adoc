= End-to-End Guide for Deploying Products into OpenShift Containers with Konflux

You can deploy products into OpenShift containers using Konflux.
In this guide, we will use Konflux to deploy PostgreSQL into an OpenShift container.

This guide assumes you have installed Konflux using the README.md file in the Konflux GitHub repository (https://github.com/cdeyoung/konflux-ci/blob/main/README.md).
If you performed a custom install, you must note all of the contexts, namespaces, and other resources you create.
You will need this information to manage Konflux and OpenShift from the terminal.

You will also need to have OpenShift installed.
You can find instructions for installing OpenShift here: https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/installation_overview/index.

== Prerequisites

Before you can use Konflux to deploy products to OpenShift, you must have the following:

- Administrative access to your OpenShift cluster.
- Administrative access to your Konflux web console.
- Access to the `crc`, `oc`, and `kubectl` commandline tools.
- Network connectivity between {ProductName} and OpenShift.

If OpenShift is installed but not running on your server, type the following command to start OpenShift:

[source, bash]
----
crc start
----

START TODO: THE INFORMATION BELOW WORKED FOR ME, BUT I'M NOT SURE IF IT IS THE BEST WAY. PLEASE CONFIRM/CORRECT.

If Konflux is installed but not running on your server, type the command below to start Konflux:

[source, bash]
----
podman start konflux-control-plane
----

END TODO

== Step 1: Access the Konflux UI and OpenShift Web Console

In this section, we'll connect to Konflux UI and OpenShift's web console.

[NOTE]
====
If you installed Konflux using the README.md file mentioned above, your Konflux UI is running in the `kind-konflux` context.
You will need this information to run various `oc` and `kubectl` commands in your server's terminal.

If you performed a custom installation, your contexts, namespaces, and other resources may be different.
====

=== Connecting to Konflux UI

To connect to your Konflux UI on the same machine your Konflux instance is running on, open a browser and navigate to https://localhost:9443.

If you're running Konflux on a terminal-only server, you can connect to the Konflux UI using a remote browser.
The easiest way to connect to the server remotely is to create an SSH tunnel.

[source, bash]
----
ssh -L 9443:localhost:9443 <your-ssh-username>@<your-konflux-server>
----

Now, open your browser and navigate to https://localhost:9443 to see the Konflux UI.
Log in using these credentials:

*Username*: `user2@konflux.dev`
*Password*: `password`

=== Connecting to the OpenShift web console.

As with Konflux UI, you can access the OpenShift web console from the same server it is running on by opening a browser and navigating to https://console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing.

If you need to access the web console from a remote workstation, you can set up an SSH tunnel like the Konflux one above using this command:

[source, bash]
----
ssh -L 8443:console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing:443 <your-ssh-username>@<your-openshift-server>
----

However, since OpenShift cannot use `localhost` and instead must use the `console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing` domain, you'll end up having to manually edit the URL to add the port 8443 after every redirect.
To get around this, you can switch from using local port forwarding (the -L switch) to using dynamic port forwarding (the -D switch).

[source, bash]
----
ssh -D 1080 -N <your-ssh-username>@<your-openshift-server>
----

This will create a SOCKS proxy that tunnels all relevant traffic transparently.
You will have to check your browser's documentation on how to configure a SOCKS proxy in your browser.

[NOTE]
====
Firefox has build-in remote DNS support, but other browsers, like Chrome and Edge, don't, so you'll need to look for a plugin like "Proxy SwitchyOmega" or "FoxyProxy" to handle DNS resolution for you.
====

== Step 2: Create a GitHub Repository For Your Manifest Files

Since there is already a PostgreSQL binary available, we'll use it instead of compiling PostgreSQL manually.
To use one of the PostgreSQL binaries, you'll need to create GitHub repository to hold your Konflux manifest and Tekton pipeline files.

Create a repository in your GitHub account with the following directory structure:

image:directory-structure.png["Directory structure for the Konflux manifest repository"]

Add the following content to your `.tekton/pipeline.yaml` file:

[source, bash]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: postgresql-manifest-pipeline
spec:
  params:
    - name: git-url
      type: string
      description: Git repository URL
    - name: revision
      type: string
      default: main
      description: Git branch/tag/commit

          workspace: source
      params:
        - name: url
          value: $(params.git-url)
        - name: revision
          value: $(params.revision)

    - name: validate-yaml
      runAfter:
        - fetch-repository
      workspaces:
        - name: source
          workspace: source
      taskSpec:
        workspaces:
          - name: source
        steps:
          - name: validate
            image: docker.io/cytopia/yamllint:latest
            script: |
              #!/bin/sh
              cd $(workspaces.source.path)
              find deployment/ -name "*.yaml" -exec yamllint {} \;
              echo "YAML validation passed"⏎
----

Add the following content to your `.tekton/release-pipeline.yaml` file:

[source, bash]

  selector:
    app: postgresql
  ports:
  - port: 5432
    targetPort: 5432
    name: postgresql
  type: ClusterIP
----

When you've finished editing these files, commit and push them to your repository's `main` branch.

== Step 3: Create a New Application

In the Konflux UI, navigate to the Namespaces tab and click on the "user-ns2" namespace.
This will automatically switch you to the "Applications" tab in the "user-ns2" namespace.

image:user-ns2-namespace.png["The Applications screen for the user-ns2 namespace"]

Now, click the "Create application" button.

image:create-application-button.png["Creating an application using Konflux UI"]

Provide a name for your applications, such as `postgresql-app`.

== Step 4: Add a Component to Your Application

From your application's screen, click on the Components tab and then click on "Add component."
Fill in the "Create a Component" form with the following values:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Application name
|postgresql-app (this is automatically populated for you.)

|Git repository url
|Enter the HTTP link to the GitHub repository you created in Step 2. It should end in `.git`.

|Git reference
|main

|Context directory
|/

|Git provider annotation
|github

|Git url annotation
|https://github.com

|Docker file
|Leave this at its default

|Component name
|postgresql-component

|Pipeline
|docker-build
|===

When you've finished, click the "Add component" button.

== Step 5: Configure a Release Plan

To deploy your PostgreSQL application to your OpenShift cluster, you'll need to configure a Release Plan.

First, click on your `postgresql-app` application in Konflux UI.
On the "Overview" tab, you should see a section titled "Create a release plan."
Click on the "Create a plan" button.

image:release-plan.png[Create a release plan]

This will bring up a page titled "Create release plan."
Fill out the form with these values:

[cols="1,2a"]
|===
|Release plan name
|postgresql-release-plan (This field is a unique identifier for this release plan.)

|Select application
|postgresql-app (This field contains the name of the application you want this release plan to apply to.)

|Where do you want to run the release pipeline?
|In this namespace: user-ns2

This field is the target tenant namespace.
This namespace is where your release pipeline will execute and where your PostgreSQL database server will be deployed in OpenShift.

|Git URL for the release pipeline
|https://github.com/your-username/your-postgresql-repo.git

|Revision
|main

|Path in directory
|+.tekton/release-pipeline.yaml+

|Service account
|openshift-pipelines TODO: Is this correct?

|Auto release
|This boolean value determines whether Konflux should automatically create a release whenever a new snapshot passes the integration tests.
If you enable it, PostgreSQL will deploy after a successful build.
Disable this field if you want to control your deployments manually.

|Standing attribution
|This boolean value tracks the author of each release for auditing purposes.
When enabled, the release plan's author is automatically attributed to all releases created from it.

|Labels
|Labels are optional metadata tags for organizing and identifying your release plan.
These are optional but recommended.
Here are some examples of labels you may want to create.

[%header,cols="2,1"]
!===
!Key
!Value

!environment
!production

!app-type
!database

!component
!postgresql
!===
|===

== Step 6: Add Persistent Storage

Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) allow you to persist storage space for your application even when your container restarts.
Since we are deploying a PostgreSQL application in this tutorial, we will create persistent storage.
You don't want your data to disappear every time your container restarts.
If you're deploying a product that doesn't need persistent storage, you can skip this step.

To create the PVC in OpenShift, follow these steps:

. Log into your OpenShift Console (not Konflux UI).

. Navigate to *Storage* > *Pesistent Volume Claims*.

+
image:persistent-volume-claims.png[Persistent Volume Claims menu, 25%]

. Ensure you're in the correct project and namespace (this is the same project and namespace you used in Konflux UI).

. Fill in the details:

- *Storage Class*: Select from the available options (ask your cluster administrator if you're unsure).

- *PVC Name*: Give your PVC a meaningful name, like `postgresql-data`.

- **Access Mode**: Select *ReadWriteOnce* (RWO) for PostgreSQL.

- *Size*: Create a size appropriate for your needs.
For this tutorial, 10 GB should be sufficient.

. Click the *Create* button.

Next, append the following YAML snippet to the end of the `/deployment/postgresql.yaml` file in the PostgreSQL manifest repository you created on GitHub.

[source, bash]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: postgresql
spec:
  containers:
  - name: postgresql
    image: your-postgresql-image
    volumeMounts:
    - name: postgres-storage
      mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data
  volumes:
  - name: postgres-storage
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: postgresql-data
----

== Step 7: Run Your PostgreSQL Pipeline

Once you've finished configuring your `postgresql-component`, Konflux should automatically create pipelines that run in the `openshift-pipeline` in your `kind-konflux` context.
The pipeline will:

- Build the component if necessary.

- Run security scans.

- Deploy your application to your OpenShift cluster in the specified namespace, which is `user-ns2` in this case.

If the pipeline doesn't automatically start, you can run it manually by going to the *Components* tab of your `postgresql-app` in Konflux UI.

image:components-tab.png[The postgresql-app's Components tab]

Then click on the three-dot menu near the bottom of the screen and select *Start new build*.

image:start-new-build.png[Start new build menu item, 25%]

== Step 8: Monitor Your Deployment

Once you've started your pipeline, you can monitor your deployment by following these steps:

. Navigate to your `postgresql-app` in Konflux UI

. Click on the *Activity* tab.

+
image:activity-tab.png[Konflux UI's pipeline Activity screen]

Konflux UI marks successful steps with a green checkmark and failed steps with a red `X`.
Steps with a yellow circle next to them are still running.

You can see detailed information about each task within the pipeline by clicking on the task's name.

You can also see information like the timestamps when the system triggered each pipeline and the Git commit that triggered the build on this tab.

== Step 9: Verify Deployment in Your OpenShift Cluster

After your build finishes in Konflux UI, switch over to OpenShift's web console and confirm that the build succeeded.
To do this:

. Open your OpenShift web console.
The URL should look something like this: `https://console-openshift-console.apps.<your-cluster-domain>`.

. Click on the *Projects* menu and verify that your `postgresql-db` project is there.

+
image:projects-menu.png[OpenShift's Projects menu, 25%]

. Click on the *Workloads* > *Pods* menu and look for `postgresql-db` pod and verify that it is running.

+
image:pods-menu.png[OpenShift's Pods menu, 25%]

. Navigate to *Workloads* > *Deployments* and ensure that the *Desired* and *Current* pod counts match (they should be 1 for this tutorial).

+
image:deployments-menu.png[OpenShift's Deployments menu, 25%]

. Navigate to the *Workloads* > *Persistent Volume Claims* menu and verify that your `postgresql-data` PVC is present.
Also, verify that it has the following properties:

+
- *Status*: Bound

- *Capacity: 10 GB (or whatever size you set this to)

- *Access Mode*: ReadWriteOnce

+
image:persistent-volume-claims.png[OpenShift's Persistent Volume Claims menu, 25%]

If everything looks good, you have successfully deployed a PostgreSQL application into your OpenShift cluster.

== Important Notes

- *Service Integration*: Konflux uses the `konflux-integration` namespace to coordinate deployments in your OpenShift cluster.

- *Pipeline as Code: You can view your Tekton pipelines in the `pipelines-as-code` namespace.

- *GitOps*: We recommend you store your products' configurations in a Git repository and let Konflux manage them through GitOps.

- *Security*: Konflux will run security scans through the `enterprise-contract-service` before deploying.
