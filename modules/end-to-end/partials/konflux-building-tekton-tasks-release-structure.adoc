The repository should be in the same level as our released tasks. For example, if our tasks are released to *<OCI registry>/<Organization>/my-team-tasks*, we should publish the list to a public repository named *<OCI registry>/<Organization>/my-team-tasks/data-acceptable-bundles*

So that the structure will be: 
----
OCI registry/
└── Organization/
    └── my-team-tasks/
        ├── task1
        ├── task2
        ├── task3
        └── data-acceptable-bundles
----
