= Default configuration

MintMaker applies a set of default options for all repositories on backend.
The configuration file can be found https://github.com/konflux-ci/mintmaker/blob/main/config/renovate/renovate.json[here].

In this page you will find a summary of the config options and decisions behind them.

For details on individual manager implementation, version support or limitations,
proceed to xref:mintmaker:support.adoc[].

== Renovate presets

- https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-config/#configrecommended[`config:recommended`] as the base template recommended by Renovate for most users
- https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-default/#gitsignoff[`:gitSignOff`] - adds the `Signed-off-by: <author>` part to commit messages
- https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-default/#disabledependencydashboard[`:disableDependencyDashboard`] - can be enabled individually in user config

== Configuration

MintMaker is set up to not require any additional onboarding (only in Konflux)
or configuration files - it works even without the `renovate.json` file present.

== Scheduling

Please refer to the main guide on scheduling xref:mintmaker:user.adoc#scheduling[here].

By default, MintMaker will not update PRs outside of the default schedule,
due to `updateNotScheduled` being `false`. More on this behavior xref:mintmaker:user.adoc#how-to-stop-prsmrs-from-being-updated-outside-of-schedule[here].

== Branch limits

We set `branchConcurrentLimit` to 0 and `pruneStaleBranches` to `false` due
to the way how MintMaker runs Renovate jobs against Konflux components.
A single repository/branch can be accessed by multiple jobs and without
this configuration, Renovate would close and reopen PRs every time it runs.

== Vulnerability alerts

We enable vulnerability alerts, but include two custom options:

- `containerVulnerabilityAlerts`
- `rpmVulnerabilityAlerts`

This serves to differentiate container and RPM xref:mintmaker:security-updates.adoc[security updates] from the other ecosystems.

== Branch naming convention

MintMaker sets a prefix `konflux/mintmaker/{{ baseBranch }}` for all its branches.

== Enabled managers

MintMaker enables a list of managers by default. The full list is accessible
xref:mintmaker:user.adoc#available-managers[here].

== Tekton updates

The `tekton` manager is pointed to the `.tekton/` folder and updates
for `quay.io/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog` and `quay.io/konflux-ci/tekton-catalog` images are grouped into a single PR/MR by default.
It also includes links for migration guides in case of major changes.

Since March 2025, MintMaker can also perform task migrations automatically
using the https://github.com/konflux-ci/pipeline-migration-tool[pipeline-migration-tool] project.

== Go updates

By default, MintMaker enables:

- Indirect dependency updates
- Updates of import paths
- The `go mod tidy` is run after updates

== Lock file maintenance

MintMaker enables `lockFileMaintenance` to support the updates of lock files
even when there are no updates to package files, for example (but not limited to) in Poetry or PDM based projects.

== pre-commit

The https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit] manager is enabled by default in MintMaker.

NOTE: pre-commit developers are not associated with this manager and users should not report issues there.

== Integration with component nudging

PRs from component nudging should have the `konflux-nudge` label. These PRs
will not be updated by MintMaker.
