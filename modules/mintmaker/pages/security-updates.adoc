= Security updates

Beginning March 2025 MintMaker provides security updates for container images
and xref:mintmaker:rpm-lockfile.adoc[RPM lockfiles]. In their nature, the security updates are like regular dependency updates, but with included information
about CVEs.

Security updates are created with a `[SECURITY]` suffix in the PR/MR title
and always ignore any configured xref:mintmaker:user.adoc#scheduling[schedule].
This way, they stand out and can be prioritized over regular dependency updates.
Users can use one of the prepared xref:mintmaker:user.adoc#configuration-presets[configuration presets] to configure automerging of security updates based
on their severity.

The CVE data is provided by Red Hat. The https://github.com/konflux-ci/mintmaker-osv-database[database] that MintMaker uses is rebuilt every hour
and includes CVE data up to 120 days old.
