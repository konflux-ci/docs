= Dependency Management Support Matrix

This page details the compatibility, support and implementation limitations
of certain managers. It is intended to supply xref:mintmaker:user.adoc#available-managers[the list of currently supported managers].

== Python dependencies

|===
| *Manager / Python version* | *3.9* | *3.10* | *3.11* | *3.12* | *3.13*
| poetry | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔
| pdm | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔
| pip-compile footnote:[pip-tools is installed using Python 3.12 and cannot be invoked for any other Python version] | - | - | - | ✔ | -
| pipenv footnote:[Only `python_version` is supported, `python_full_version` can fail for specific Python versions] | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔
| uv footnote:[uv supports any Python version by installing it at runtime] | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔
|===

- Only minor versions (e.g. 3.13) are generally supported, patch versions (e.g. 3.13.4) are not
- Python 3.8 and older are not supported.
- `peynv` is available and used to install Python 3.10 and Python 3.13, which are not available in UBI images.

=== Using `uv pip compile` instead of pip-compile

If Python 3.12 for `pip-compile` is not sufficient for your project, consider using `uv pip compile` instead, see the https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compatibility/#pip-compile-defaults[uv docs] and https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/pip-compile/#additional-information[Renovate docs].

In order to start using `uv pip compile`, run this command once manually:
`uv pip compile --python-version=3.13 requirements.in --output-file=requirements.txt` and push the file into the repository.

Once done, the file should have this header:

[source]
----
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile --python-version=3.13 --output-file=requirements.txt requirements.in
----

and Renovate will parse the version from it. By changing the `--python-version`
argument you can force the locking mechanism to use any Python version you need.

== RPM lock files

|===
| *Capability* | *Supported*
| Generate a new `rpms.lock.yaml` | No
| Update existing `rpms.lock.yaml` | Yes
| Update multiple lock files in subdirectories | Yes
| Work with different lock file in multiple branches | Yes
| Display individual package upgrades in PR description | No
a| Match CVE data to package upgrades

(root `rpms.lock.yaml`) | Yes
a| Match CVE data to package upgrades

(subdirectory `rpms.lock.yaml`) | Yes
|===

== Go dependencies

MintMaker sets the `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto` environment variable, so when updating dependencies,
Go will choose the correct toolchain version automatically.

Renovate will automatically update the go and toolchain directives in case it is required
by an updated dependency. This cannot be changed in the configuration.
