= Dependency Management Support Matrix

This page details the compatibility, support and implementation limitations
of certain managers. It is intended to supply xref:mintmaker:user.adoc#available-managers[the list of currently supported managers].

== Python dependencies

|===
| *Manager / Python version* | *3.9* | *3.10* | *3.11* | *3.12* | *3.13*
| poetry | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔
| pdm | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔
| pip-compile footnote:[pip-tools is installed using Python 3.12 and cannot be invoked for any other Python version] | - | - | - | ✔ | -
| pipenv | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔
| uv footnote:[uv supports any Python version by installing it at runtime] | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔
|===

- Python 3.8 and older are not supported.
- `peynv` is available and used to install Python 3.10 and Python 3.13, which are not available in UBI images.

=== Using `uv` instead of pip-compile

If Python 3.12 for `pip-compile` is not sufficient for your project, consider using `uv pip compile` instead, see the https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compatibility/#pip-compile-defaults[uv docs] and https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/pip-compile/#additional-information[Renovate docs].

== RPM lock files

|===
| *Capability* | *Supported*
| Generate a new `rpms.lock.yaml` | No
| Update existing `rpms.lock.yaml` | Yes
| Update multiple lock files in subdirectories | No
| Work with different lock file in multiple branches | No footnote:[Only a single branch is properly supported at the moment]
| Display individual package upgrades in PR description | Yes
a| Match CVE data to package upgrades

(root `rpms.lock.yaml`) | Yes footnote:[Occassionally the `[SECURITY\]` label might be missing, despite CVE description being included]
a| Match CVE data to package upgrades

(subdirectory `rpms.lock.yaml`) | No
|===

== Go dependencies

MintMaker sets the `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto` environment variable, so when updating dependencies,
Go will choose the correct toolchain version automatically.
