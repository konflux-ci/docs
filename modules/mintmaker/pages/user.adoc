= Dependency Management
== Introduction

MintMaker is a service built on top of https://docs.renovatebot.com/[Renovate]. It includes the xref:mintmaker:rpm-lockfile.adoc[RPM lockfile extension] and integration with https://konflux-ci.dev/[Konflux CI].

Renovate is a tool that automates dependency updates in your repository. Its goal
is to make dependency management easier and a continued practice. That way, your
project will always have the latest fixes for bugs and security issues.

In this documentation, when we mention something about Renovate, it will be a
general statement. Therefore it will also apply to MintMaker, since it runs an
underlying Renovate service. However, when we say something about
MintMaker, it is a specific statement that might not apply to other Renovate 
instances.

== Security

CAUTION: Always verify that the PRs/MRs for dependency updates are created by verified Konflux accounts.

=== GitHub

All MintMaker PRs are created using the https://github.com/apps/red-hat-konflux[red-hat-konflux] GitHub app. All commits should contain this signature:

[source,plain]
----
Signed-off-by: red-hat-konflux <126015336+red-hat-konflux[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>
----

and should be signed with GPG key `B5690EEEBB952194`:

image::gpg-signature-github.png[height="auto" alt="Image showing a valid GPG signature"]

On Konflux staging, the account uses the https://github.com/apps/konflux-staging[konflux-staging] app and a different email:

[source,plain]
----
Signed-off-by: konflux-staging <124796549+konflux-staging[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>
----

while the GPG key is the same.

=== GitLab

On GitLab the account used is different for each project or group. The account
name is `konflux`, but the email used is in the following format:

For projects: `project_<project ID>_bot_<32 hex characters>@noreply.gitlab.com`

For groups: `group_<group ID>_bot_<32 hex characters>@noreply.gitlab.com`

The project ID or group ID must come from your project or group when
xref:building:creating-secrets.adoc#gitlab-source-secret[setting up the secrets].

=== Registry credentials

Renovate requires registry credentials to update container images from private registries. Users must provide these credentials via secrets and link them to the component-specific service account in their user namespace.

NOTE: If you have already provided registry credentials for building, MintMaker will automatically reuse them.

If you aren't receiving updates for an image from an authenticated registry, ensure that a secret with the registry credentials has been created and linked to the appropriate component-specific service account. You can find instructions for creating and linking these secrets xref:ROOT:building:creating-secrets.adoc#creating-registry-pull-secrets[here].

IMPORTANT: The secret type must be `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`. MintMaker will ignore any other secret types.

== Configuration

Renovate is a very configurable tool. Since every project has its unique
needs, it is fundamental to take advantage of that flexibility to make MintMaker
work in the best possible manner.

The MintMaker team provides xref:mintmaker:default-config.adoc[a base set of configurations] that provide a sensible
starting point. It enables users to have a good experience out of the box.

=== Create your custom configuration

The base configuration can be found https://github.com/konflux-ci/mintmaker/blob/main/config/renovate/renovate.json[here].
This config file is applied to all repositories onboarded in Konflux and serves
as our global Renovate configuration.

IMPORTANT: Do not copy the base configuration to your own project. Always start with an empty configuration file as described below.

NOTE: While this link points to the latest global configuration, our deployment
may use a configuration from a specific commit. However, in most cases, there
won't be any conflicts between the deployed version and the latest version. For
reference purposes, you can refer to the latest version of the configuration.

Individual repositories can override this config to tweak Renovate's behavior to
their needs by adding a `renovate.json` file in the top level directory (or any
of the locations listed at the top of https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/[this page]
are also supported, for simplicity, this document always refers to `renovate.json`)
of the repository's *default branch*.
All available configuration options can be found in 
https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/[Renovate documentation].

When customizing your configs, use the following base template to build on:

[source,json]
----
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json"
}
----

=== Configuration presets

Before diving deeper into all the possible configuarion options, consider using
one of MintMaker's https://github.com/konflux-ci/mintmaker-presets[prepared presets]. Presets provide predefined options that can
be added to the `extends` field in your renovate.json, as suggested below.
Multiple presets can be combined as needed.

[source,json]
----
{
  "extends": ["github>konflux-ci/mintmaker-presets:<preset name>"]
}
----

The following table describes presets available at current time. In addition to
MintMaker presets, you can also explore options from the https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-default/[official Renovate documentation].

[options="header"]
|===
|*Preset name* |*Description*
|cve-automerge-all* | Automerge all CVE fixes
|cve-automerge-critical* | Automerge CVE fixes with Critical severity
|cve-automerge-high* | Automerge CVE fixes with High severity or higher
|cve-automerge-moderate* | Automerge CVE fixes with Moderate severity or higher
|update-fedora-to-stable | Suggest only stable Fedora releases (based on https://endoflife.date/fedora[endoflife.date])
|group-python-requirements | Group `requirement.txt` updates into a single PR
|group-python-poetry | Group Poetry updates into a single PR
|===

CAUTION: *These presets will not enable automerge for RPM security updates. The instructions for enabling automerge for RPMs can be found xref:mintmaker:rpm-lockfile.adoc#how-to-enable-automerge-for-rpm-security-updates[here]

=== Overriding manager specific configuration

To override a single manager's configuration, you need to follow the same pattern
used in the base config, for example to override the grouping of `tekton` manager:

[source,json]
----
{
  "tekton": {
    "packageRules": [
      {
        "matchPackageNames": [],
        ...
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

If you were to define the `packageRules` outside of the `tekton` option,
your rules wouldn't take any effect, because `tekton` -> `packageRules` is more specific.

== Available managers

Renovate is based around the concept of package managers. Package managers
are tools that manage dependencies in a certain category, programming language or configuration file. While some managers work
"out of the box", for others (e.g. Kubernetes or `regex` manager) you need to
specify the details in the `renovate.json` configuration file. You can refer
to a specific manager in the
https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/[Renovate manager section].

We are working on enabling every manager available in Renovate. The list of currently
enabled managers is available below.

|===

Managers with a strikethrough are supported by Renovate, but not currently enabled or
officially supported in MintMaker. You can enable them customizing your `renovate.json`. However, the MintMaker team cannot guarantee any level of functionality and will not provide support for these managers.

NOTE: Detailed compatibility/support matrix for certain managers can be found
xref:mintmaker:support.adoc[here].

CAUTION: The `pip-compile` manager will currently update dependencies using Python 3.12
(even if the user applies https://docs.renovatebot.com/language-constraints-and-upgrading/#applying-constraints-through-config[constraints]
in the configuration). Our Renovate instance relies on tools installed in the container image and cannot
dynamically upgrade or downgrade the pip-compile version at current time.

NOTE: The `enabledManagers` configuration option in Renovate is not extendable between global
and repository-level configurations. When enabling additional managers in your repository's
`renovate.json`, you need to specify a complete list of *all* desired managers.

== Scheduling

MintMaker has a base schedule which runs every 4 hours, starting at 00:00 UTC (i.e. 04:00, 08:00, 12:00, ...).
While you can configure some aspects of your renovate schedule (see below), you cannot influence MintMaker to run any more frequently than this base schedule.

All enabled managers run according to this base schedule, except the Tekton manager which has a manager-specific schedule and runs on Saturdays after 5 AM UTC.

[cols="30%,70%",option="header"]
|===
|*Schedule (UTC)* | *Managers*
|at any time | managers except tekton
|saturday after 5 AM | tekton
|===

=== Overriding the default schedule

While you cannot override the base renovate schedule (every 4 hours), you can override when different managers are scheduled for your repository by modifying the https://docs.renovatebot.com/key-concepts/scheduling/[`schedule`] config option.

**Top-level schedule**: Apply the schedule globally in your repository for all managers by using `schedule` in the top level of the config file:

[source,json]
----
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "schedule": ["* * * * 0,6"]
}
----

NOTE: MintMaker's global Renovate configuration includes a manager-specific schedule for the Tekton manager as described above. This manager-specific schedules take precedence over the top-level "schedule" setting from your repo's Renovate config file. To use your preferred schedule for the Tekton manager, you must explicitly override this manager-specific schedule.

**Manager-specific schedule**: Configure schedules for specific managers:

[source,json]
----
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "tekton": {
    "schedule": ["* * * * 0,6"]
  }
}
----

If you have multiple manager-specific schedules to configure or override, you can add a package rule like this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "packageRules": [
    {
      "matchManagers": ["gomod", "tekton"],
      "schedule": ["* * * * 0,6"]
    }
  ]
}
----

== Custom container files

The Renovate's https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/dockerfile/[manager for container files] has a specific rule to match files:

[source]
----
(^|/|\.)([Dd]ocker|[Cc]ontainer)file$
(^|/)([Dd]ocker|[Cc]ontainer)file[^/]*$
----

If your container/Docker file has a different name, you will need to extend the match rule, which can be done following https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/#file-matching[these instructions].

The `fileMatch` configuration is mergeable, meaning that when
setting new values in the repository config, they will not override the default
config. Instead the new values will be merged together with the existing rules.

For example, you can add a section like this in your `renovate.json` file:

[source,json]
----
{
  "dockerfile": {
    "fileMatch": [
        "path/to/containerfile1",
        "path/to/containerfile2"
    ]
  }
}
----

== Ignoring certain dependencies

If you don't want updates to certain dependencies, but don't want to disable
the whole manager, you can use the https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#ignoredeps[`ignoreDeps`] option:

[source,json]
----
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "ignoreDeps": [
    "registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-operator-registry",
    "registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-operator-registry-rhel9",
    "brew.registry.redhat.io/rh-osbs/openshift-ose-operator-registry-rhel9"
  ]
}
----

== Advanced topics

=== Offboarding a repository

If you intend to disable MintMaker for your repository, please follow
this guide.

==== Prerequisites

- Ensure you have CLI access to the Konflux cluster where your component is created.
- Ensure you have necessary permission to annotate a component.

==== Steps

- Determine the Konflux component you want to off-board from MintMaker.
- Use the `kubectl` or `oc` command to add the annotation `mintmaker.appstudio.redhat.com/disabled: "true"` to the component.

Example:

[source,bash]
----
oc -n <namespace> annotate component/<component-name> mintmaker.appstudio.redhat.com/disabled=true
----
NOTE: This annotation disables MintMaker at the component level (a specific repository and branch combination).
When a repository or branch has multiple components, you must annotate each component individually to disable MintMaker for the entire branch or repository.

=== How to limit the number of PRs/MRs

If you find that you are receiving too many PRs/MRs from MintMaker, there are configuration
options available to limit the number of open requests or the rate at which they are created.
Below are the available options that you can set per repository in your `renovate.json`.

https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#prconcurrentlimit[`prConcurrentLimit`]: This option sets a limit on the number of open PRs/MRs that Renovate will
create concurrently. The default is 10.

https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#branchconcurrentlimit[`branchConcurrentLimit`]: This option sets a limit on the maximum number of branches that can be
created concurrently by Renovate. This option will reduce the time taken to rebase every update from Renovate. The default is unlimited.

https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#prhourlylimit[`prHourlyLimit`]: This option controls the number of PRs that Renovate will create per hour.
`prHourlyLimit` helps to limit the rate of opening new PRs. The default is 2.

https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#schedule[`schedule`]: Defines specific times when Renovate is allowed to create branches and PRs. This can
help prevent PRs from being created during busy periods.

Here is an example combining these options:

[source,json]
----
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "prConcurrentLimit": 5,
  "branchConcurrentLimit": 0,
  "prHourlyLimit": 2,
  "schedule": ["after 10pm and before 6am on every weekday"]
}
----

CAUTION: Since MintMaker disables `pruneStaleBranches`, it is *not recommended*
to modify `branchConcurrentLimit` in any way. The accumulation of old branches
could lead to no new PRs/MRs getting created.

=== How to stop PRs/MRs from being updated outside of schedule

If you set up a schedule for your repository via the https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#schedule[`schedule`] config, it's possible that MintMaker will still update PRs/MRs outside of the allowed times.

The `schedule` config manages branch creation, but will not stop updates to PRs/MRs from branches that are already created. If you want to prevent this behavior, use
https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#updatenotscheduled[`updateNotScheduled`] option, which when set to `false` will disallow for updates in existing PRs/MRs outside of the schedule:

[source,json]
----
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "updateNotScheduled": false
}
----

The default value of `updateNotScheduled` is `true`, which leads to this behavior that might seem unexpected at first.

=== Automerge

It is possible to configure Renovate to merge updates automatically for specific
dependencies. You can find the documentation on this topic https://docs.renovatebot.com/key-concepts/automerge/[here].

When enabled for a given PR/MR, the automerge will happen provided two conditions are met:

- the repository CI pipeline ran successfully, and
- the PR/MR branch is up-to-date with the base branch.

Because of the need for the CI pipeline to succeed, you should expect that the
merge will only happen on the next MintMaker run.

This following timeline exemplifies the events leading to an automerge in a repository:

[cols="20%,80%",options="header"]
|===
|Time  | Event
|__[10:00am]__ | MintMaker run 1 starts 
|__[10:01am]__ | PR for dependency `xyz` is filed
|__[10:02am]__ | CI pipeline is started
|__[10:05am]__ | CI pipeline finishes successfully
|__[10:10am]__ | MintMaker run 1 is finished
|... | ...
|__[12:00am]__ | MintMaker run 2 starts
|__[12:01am]__ | PR for dependency `xyz` is detected
|__[12:02am]__ | PR for dependency `xyz` is automerged
|===

You can also enable automerge without the need of CI tests passing, by
setting https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#ignoretests[`ignoreTests`] to `true`.

Because of the need for the PR/MR branch being up-to-date with the base branch,
automerging multiple branches at once does not work. 

NOTE: Automerging can be risky. Since the merges will happen without anyone
looking at the code, they have a higher risk of introducing regression.

It is _very important_ to have a good test coverage in place, to mitigate that 
risk.

You can set automerge only for a certain type of updates. For example, updates
to patch and minor updates of certain packages.

For example, to enable automerge for non-major updates on all dependencies, you
can add the following to `renovate.json`:

[source,json]
----
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "packageRules": [
    {
      "description": "Automerge non-major updates",
      "matchUpdateTypes": ["minor", "patch"],
      "automerge": true
    }
  ]
}
----
alternatively, to enable non-major updates only for specific packages, you can use:

[source,json]
----
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "packageRules": [
    {
      "description": "Automerge non-major updates on depA and depB",
      "matchUpdateTypes": ["minor", "patch"],
      "matchPackageNames": ["depA", "depB"],
      "automerge": true
    }
  ]
}
----

See Renovate's https://docs.renovatebot.com/key-concepts/automerge/#configuration-examples[docs]
on this topic for further examples. They show how to set automerge for specific
dependency groups, types, etc.

Finally, to check if automerge is cofigured for a given PR/MR, you can look for 
the annotation "Automerge: Enabled" in the PR/MR body.

==== Bypassing approvals

In order to allow Renovate to automatically merge PRs with dependency updates
in repositories that normally require code reviews before merging,
you can configure a bypass rule just for Renovate, by navigating to
*Settings* -> *Rules* -> *Rulesets* and adding *Red Hat Konflux* app
to a bypass list, like so:

image::approval-bypass.png[height="auto" alt="Image showing how to add a bypass rule for Red Hat Konflux app"]

==== Automerge using OpenShift CI/Prow

Since the Red Hat Konflux app is a trusted app for the OpenShift CI bot, you can
configure Renovate to automatically add approval labels by using the following config:

[source,json]
----
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "addLabels": [
    "/approve",
    "/lgtm"
  ]
}
----

You can also combine https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#addlabels[`addLabels`] with any https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#packagerules[`packageRules`] combination.

=== Inherited config

Renovate supports the use of an https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-overview/#inherited-config[Inherited config].
The Inherited config file is used to apply the same Renovate settings to all repositories in an organization/group.
This functionality is useful if your organization contains many repositories that should use the same 
or similar Renovate configuration.

If you want to use the inherited config, it must be located in the repository `<organization>/renovate-config` and
the file must be named `org-inherited-config.json`. The file can contain any 
https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/[configuration options] that you want to apply to all repositories in an organization.

Please note the applied order of Renovate config files:

* Default config
* Global config
* Inherited config
* Repository config
* Resolved presets referenced in config

Configurations applied later will overwrite prior values. This means that inherited config can be used to modify
MintMaker's default behavior. Similarly, repository config overwrites inherited config, so organization-wide settings can
be changed on a per repository basis. If you want to learn more about how Renovate applies configuration, take a look
at the https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-overview/[Renovate configuration overview].

Please note that the use of inherited config is optional and its absence will not result in an error.

=== Specify the registry in your FROM line

Let's imagine that your `Containerfile` or `Dockerfile` has the following FROM line:

[source]
----
FROM ubi9/ubi:9.4-1123
----

In this case, the ubi9 image is pulled from the client's default registry, which might be `docker.io`, for example.
This might lead to errors, such as MintMaker being unable to update your `Containerfile` or `Dockerfile`
due to missing credentials for accessing that registry. In order to avoid this issue, specify the registry explicitly, such as:

[source]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi:9.4-1123
----

NOTE: docker.io registry is not supported by MintMaker by default.

=== Enable container image tag versioning

It is recommended to specify the base images using a digest, like so:

[source]
----
FROM registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi-minimal:latest@sha256:cf095e5668919ba1b4ace3888107684ad9d587b1830d3eb56973e6a54f456e67
----

However, if you prefer to use image tags as versions, Renovate might not be able to update them by default.
To enable the tag updates, use the following config for all container images:

[source]
----
{
  "dockerfile": {
    "versioning": "redhat"
  }
}
----

or just for specific images using the https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#packagerules[packageRules] option:

[source]
----
{
  "packageRules": [
    {
      "matchDatasources": ["docker"],
      "matchPackageNames": ["registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi-minimal"],
      "versioning": "redhat"
    }
  ]
}
----

or take a look at the https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-workarounds/#workaroundssupportredhatimageversion[workarounds:supportRedHatImageVersion] preset for other available options.

=== Cleanup

Renovate creates a branch for each update, but these branches will not be removed,
because MintMaker disables the `pruneStaleBranches` option. It is not recommended
to enable this option, however alternative options exist.

==== Automatic deletion of branches on GitHub

You can enable the option to *Automatically delete head branches* as described
in https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-the-automatic-deletion-of-branches[this GitHub documentation page].
