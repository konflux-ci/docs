= Pattern: Centralizing Tekton Pipeline Definitions in Your Repository

This pattern describes how to extract a common Tekton `Pipeline` definition into a local file within your application's Git repository (e.g., `.tekton/build-pipeline.yaml`). Your `PipelineRun` files can then reference this local pipeline, promoting consistency, simplifying maintenance, and enabling version control of the pipeline logic alongside your application code.

This approach is particularly beneficial when you need to customize a standard pipeline or ensure that all build triggers (e.g., push, pull request) use the exact same underlying pipeline tasks and structure.

.Use Cases
* Ensuring all `PipelineRun` files (for pushes, pull requests, manual triggers) use an identical, version-controlled pipeline definition.
* Simplifying the maintenance of pipeline logic by having a single source of truth within the repository.* Facilitating easier implementation of other patterns, such as <<Pattern: Achieving Label and Tag Parity for Versioning>>, by providing a single pipeline file to modify.

.Prerequisites
* Your application has been onboarded to {ProductName}.
* {ProductName} (via Pipelines-as-Code) has generated initial `PipelineRun` files in your repository's `.tekton/` directory, or you have `PipelineRun` files that reference a remote Tekton Hub or bundle.
* You have identified the base Tekton `Pipeline` specification you intend to use and customize. This might be from:
    * The `spec.pipelineSpec` embedded in one of your existing `PipelineRun` files. There is a helper command to extract the pipeline definition from the first PipelineRun file xref:centralize-pipeline-definitions.adoc#helper-command[here].
    * A standard pipeline definition from the {ProductName} Tekton catalog (e.g., `docker-build-multi-platform-oci-ta`).

.Procedure

. **Create a Local Pipeline Definition File:**
   In your repository, create a new YAML file within the `.tekton/` directory, for example, `.tekton/build-pipeline.yaml`. This file will contain your `kind: Pipeline` resource.

. **Define the `Pipeline` Resource:**
   Populate `.tekton/build-pipeline.yaml` with the `Pipeline` definition.

. **Update `PipelineRun` Files to Reference the Local Pipeline:**
   Modify your existing `PipelineRun` files (e.g., `component-push.yaml`, `component-on-pull-request.yaml`) in the `.tekton/` directory.
    * Remove the `spec.pipelineSpec` section if it contains an embedded pipeline definition.
    * Remove or update the `spec.pipelineRef.bundle` if it points to a remote bundle you are now localizing.
    * Ensure `spec.pipelineRef.name` points to the `metadata.name` you defined in your `.tekton/build-pipeline.yaml`.

  params:
    # ... your parameters for this PipelineRun ...
  
  workspaces:
    # ... your workspaces for this PipelineRun ...
----
====

. **Commit and Push Changes:**
   Commit the new `.tekton/build-pipeline.yaml` file and the modified `PipelineRun` files to your Git repository.

. **Apply the Pipeline Definition to Your Cluster (If Not Handled by PaC):**
   Ensure the `Pipeline` resource defined in `.tekton/build-pipeline.yaml` is applied to your Kubernetes/OpenShift namespace where {ProductName} runs your builds. Pipelines-as-Code might handle this automatically if it detects a `kind: Pipeline` in the `.tekton` directory. If not, you might need to apply it manually or via your GitOps tooling:
   `kubectl apply -f .tekton/build-pipeline.yaml -n your-namespace`

.Verification
* Trigger a new build (e.g., by pushing to your main branch or creating a PR).
* {ProductName} (via Pipelines-as-Code) should create a `PipelineRun` instance that uses your locally defined `build-pipeline`.
* Monitor the `PipelineRun` to ensure it executes as expected, using the tasks and logic defined in your `.tekton/build-pipeline.yaml`.

.Helper Command
====
To quickly extract a pipeline definition from your PipelineRun files, you can use these commands:

[source,bash]
----
# Auto-detect a PipelineRun file and extract its pipeline definition
PIPELINE_NAME="build-pipeline" # Change this to your desired pipeline name
FIRST_FILE=$(find .tekton -name '*-push.yaml' -o -name '*-pull-request.yaml' | head -1)
[ -z "$FIRST_FILE" ] && echo "No PipelineRun files found in .tekton/" && exit 1

echo "Extracting pipeline from $FIRST_FILE..."
yq eval '{"apiVersion": "tekton.dev/v1", "kind": "Pipeline", "metadata": {"name": "'$PIPELINE_NAME'"}, "spec": .spec.pipelineSpec}' "$FIRST_FILE" > ".tekton/${PIPELINE_NAME}.yaml"

# Update all PipelineRun files to reference the extracted pipeline
for f in .tekton/*-{push,pull-request}.yaml; do
    [ -f "$f" ] && echo "Updating $f..." && yq eval 'del(.spec.pipelineSpec) | .spec.pipelineRef.name = "'$PIPELINE_NAME'"' -i "$f"
done
----

The commands will:
1. Find the first available PipelineRun file in your `.tekton` directory
2. Create a new Pipeline file with proper metadata in the `.tekton` directory
3. Update all matching PipelineRun files to reference the extracted pipeline

[TIP]
=====
* Only modify the `PIPELINE_NAME` if you want something other than "build-pipeline"
* The command automatically finds PipelineRun files matching `*-push.yaml` or `*-pull-request.yaml`
* If you need to use a specific file, you can override it: `FIRST_FILE=.tekton/my-custom-file.yaml` before running the commands
=====
====

.Benefits
* **Maintainability**: Pipeline logic is defined in one place, making updates and troubleshooting easier.
* **Consistency**: All `PipelineRun` instances referencing this local pipeline will use the exact same tasks and configurations.
* **Version Control**: The pipeline definition is version-controlled alongside your application code, providing a clear history of changes.
* **Customization Control**: You have full control over the pipeline definition without being tied to potentially changing remote bundle versions (unless your tasks still reference remote bundles, which is common).
* **Simplified Complex Customizations**: When implementing patterns like <<Pattern: Achieving Label and Tag Parity for Versioning>>, you only need to modify one `build-pipeline.yaml` file instead of multiple `PipelineRun` files or managing complex embedded specs.

By centralizing your Tekton `Pipeline` definition within your repository, you gain greater control, maintainability, and consistency over your build processes in {ProductName}.
