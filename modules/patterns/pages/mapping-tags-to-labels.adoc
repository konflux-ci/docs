= Pattern: Achieving Label and Tag Parity for Versioning

This pattern describes how to configure your {ProductName} build pipeline to ensure parity between a key version label (e.g., `org.opencontainers.image.version`) on your container image and a human-readable image tag. This enhances image traceability and makes it easier for users and tools to identify image versions consistently.

The core idea is to use a common dynamic value, typically derived from Git metadata like the branch name or a release tag, to populate both the label and the tag.

.Use Cases
* Consistently versioning images based on the Git branch they were built from.
* Ensuring that the version displayed in image metadata (labels) matches a discoverable image tag.
* Simplifying image identification for users and automated deployment systems.
* Enabling the determination of an image's original tag (e.g., version) by inspecting its labels, even when only an image digest is available.

.Prerequisites
* A {ProductName} build pipeline defined in your repository (e.g., `.tekton/build-pipeline.yaml`).
    * **Note:** It is highly recommended to first centralize your pipeline definition using one of the methods described in xref:managing-pipeline-changes.adoc[Evolving build pipeline management]. This will simplify the modifications needed for label and tag parity, as you'll only need to edit one Tekton Pipeline file.
* Your pipeline includes:
    * A `clone-repository` task (e.g., using `git-clone-oci-ta`).
    * A `generate-labels` task (e.g., using `task-generate-labels`).
    * An `apply-tags` task (e.g., using `task-apply-tags`).

.Procedure

. **Define a Common Versioning Parameter in Your Pipeline:**
   Add an `artifact-version` parameter to your `build-pipeline.yaml`. This parameter will be the source of truth for the version string.
+
[source,yaml]
----
# In .tekton/build-pipeline.yaml
spec:
  params:
    # ... other params ...
    - name: artifact-version
      description: The version string to be used for labels and tags.
      type: string
      default: "latest" # A sensible default
----

. **Use `artifact-version` in the `generate-labels` Task:**
   Configure the `generate-image-labels` task in your `build-pipeline.yaml` to use the `artifact-version` parameter for the `org.opencontainers.image.version` label (or a similar version label).
+
[source,yaml]
----
# In .tekton/build-pipeline.yaml (within the 'tasks' section)
    - name: generate-image-labels
      # ... other task configurations ...
      params:
        - name: label-templates
          value:
             # ... other labels like build-date, release ...
             - "version=$(params.artifact-version)" # OCI version label
             # Or, more specifically for OCI:
             # - "org.opencontainers.image.version=$(params.artifact-version)"
        - name: source-date-epoch
          value: "$(tasks.clone-repository.results.commit-timestamp)"
      # ...
----

. **Use `artifact-version` in the `apply-tags` Task:**
   Configure the `apply-tags` task in your `build-pipeline.yaml` to create a tag based on the `artifact-version` parameter. You might also want to create other related tags, like one incorporating a timestamp or commit SHA for uniqueness.
+
[source,yaml]
----
# In .tekton/build-pipeline.yaml (within the 'tasks' section)
    - name: apply-tags
      # ... other task configurations ...
      params:
        - name: IMAGE
          value: $(tasks.build-image-index.results.IMAGE_URL)
        - name: ADDITIONAL_TAGS
          value:
            # Tag directly with the artifact-version
            - "$(params.artifact-version)"
            # Optionally, a more unique tag incorporating the artifact-version and timestamp
            - "$(params.artifact-version)-$(tasks.clone-repository.results.commit-timestamp)"
            # Optionally, add 'latest' for main branch builds (can be conditional)
            # - "latest"
      # ...
----

. **Populate `artifact-version` Dynamically in `PipelineRun` Files:**
   In your `PipelineRun` files (e.g., for push and PR events), use Pipelines-as-Code (PaC) variables to set the `artifact-version` parameter dynamically.
+
[source,yaml]
----
# In .tekton/component-push.yaml (for push to main branch)
spec:
  params:
    # ... other params ...
    - name: artifact-version
      value: '{{target_branch}}' # e.g., results in label "version: main" and tag "main"

# In .tekton/component-on-pull-request.yaml (for PRs)
spec:
  params:
    # ... other params ...
    - name: artifact-version
      # Example: "main-pr-123" or "feature-branch-pr-123"
      value: '{{target_branch}}-pr-{{pull_request_number}}'
----

.Verification
. After a pipeline run, inspect the built image:
  * **Labels**: Check the image labels (e.g., using `docker inspect` or `skopeo inspect`). The `org.opencontainers.image.version` (or your chosen version label) should match the value derived from `artifact-version` (e.g., `main`).
  * **Tags**: Check the image tags in your container registry. You should find a tag that directly matches the `artifact-version` (e.g., `main`).

.Benefits of this Pattern
* **Consistency**: Ensures the version information embedded in the image (label) matches a discoverable tag.
* **Traceability**: Makes it easy to correlate a tagged image with its source branch or PR.
* **Automation Friendly**: Provides a predictable versioning scheme for downstream automation and deployment tools.
* **Clarity**: Offers a clear version identifier for users browsing the container registry.

By implementing this pattern, you establish a robust and clear versioning strategy for your container images built with {ProductName}.
