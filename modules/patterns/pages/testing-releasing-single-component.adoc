= Testing and Releasing a Single Component

By default, {ProductName} treats applications as a set of dependent components. A example would be frontend and backend
components. A user may typically want to build, test, and release these components together
to ensure there are compatible.

Applications may also consist of independent components. If a user wants to group components together in an application
a failure in one component will normally prevent any components from releasing.
In **Single Component Mode**, however, each component in an application is separated so that one component's failing
Conforma Policy will not prevent the other components from releasing.

== Enabling Single Component Mode

Single component mode works by analyzing the Snapshot that is being used for Integration Tests and Releasing.
A Snapshot created due to a single component being built is the only Snapshot type that may be used for this
mode.

=== Enabling Single Component Mode for Conforma Integration Test Scenarios

Single Component Mode can be enabled by updating the existing Integration Test Scenario (either by editing the custom resource or by using the UI).

[NOTE]
====
It is also possible to maintain *separate* Integration Test Scenarios:

* One which validates the entire suite of components in an application (default mode)
* One which validates a single component.

Additionally, you may xref:testing:integration/choosing-contexts.adoc[mark an Integration Test Scenario as *disabled*], therefore permitting xref:testing:integration/rerunning.adoc[manual execution] when needed.

====

==== Updating Conforma Integration Test Scenarios
* Update the custom resource by adding the parameter *SINGLE_COMPONENT* with a value of *true*

[source,yaml]
.integration-test-scenario.yaml
----
spec:
  params:
    - name: SINGLE_COMPONENT
      value: 'true'
----

[NOTE]
====
You need to apply the change using *kubectl*
====

* Alternatively, you may edit the Integration Test Scenario using the HAC UI as follows:

image::single-component-integration-test-scenario.png[role="border" alt="Editing your Integration Test Scenario"]

=== Enabling Single Component Mode for Releases

Single Component Mode can be enabled for Releases by making a change to the ReleasePlanAdmission custom resource.

* Update the custom resource by adding the field *singleComponentMode* under _.spec.data_ with a value of *true*

[source,yaml]
.release-plan-admission.yaml
----
spec:
  data:
    singleComponentMode: true
----

[NOTE]
====
You need to apply the change using *kubectl*

=== Verifying Test Results and Releases in Single Component Mode

* Once your changes have been applied, you can verify that the mode is in fact activated.

==== Verifying Conforma Integration Test Scenario results

* Navigate to the logs of your Conforma Integration Test Scenario pipeline.
* Locate the *reduce* step in the log.
* It should resemble the following output:

[source]
--
[reduce] Single Component mode? true
[reduce] SNAPSHOT_CREATION_TYPE: component
[reduce] SNAPSHOT_CREATION_COMPONENT: comp2
[reduce] Single Component mode is true and Snapshot type is component
[reduce] COMPONENT_COUNT: 1
--

==== Verifying Release pipeline logs

* Navigate to the logs of your Release pipeline.
* Locate the *reduce-snapshot* task in the logs.
* It should resemble the following output:

[source]
--
reduce-snapshot
