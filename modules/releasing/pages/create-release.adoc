= Creating a release

A Release CR is created to submit a specific Application Snapshot to be processed according to the referenced ReleasePlan.

== Creating a `Release` object

The development team creates a `Release` object in the developer tenant namespace. The `Release` object includes a reference to the application snapshot that the development team wants to release, along with release plan that will be used to release the application.

* You have completed the steps listed in the xref:ROOT:getting-started.adoc#getting-started-with-the-cli[Getting started in the CLI] page.
* You have completed the steps for creating a ReleasePlanAdmission and a matching ReleasePlan.
