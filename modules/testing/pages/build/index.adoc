= Build-time tests

This document covers the build-time tests that {ProductName} runs as part of its component build pipeline. These build-time tests automatically check all application images to inform you if they're up-to-date, correctly formatted, and protected from security vulnerabilities.

NOTE: These tests are non-blocking and do not prevent the pipeline from proceeding if issues are found. The tests use link:https://konflux-ci.dev/architecture/ADR/0030-tekton-results-naming-convention.html[results conventions] in order to indicate the status of the tests and scans that are run.

The component build pipeline for {ProductName} include various types of build-time tests, conducted using link:https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/tasks/#overview[Tekton tasks].

The table below outlines the default build-time tests:

.Deprecated image checks
|===
|Test name |Description |Failure message

|image_repository_deprecated |Deprecated images are no longer maintained, leading to unresolved security vulnerabilities. | The container image must not be built from a repository  marked as 'Deprecated' in COMET
|===

.Unsigned RPM check
|===
|Test name |Description |Failure message

|image_unsigned_rpms |Packages signed with Red Hat's secure signing server adheres to stringent policies and procedures. |Alerts the user for any unsigned RPMs. Found following unsigned rpms(nvra):
|===

.Security checks
|===
|Test name |Description |Failure message

|clair-scan |Scans container images for vulnerabilities using Clair, by comparing the components of container image against Clair's vulnerability databases. | Found packages with critical vulnerabilities associated with RHSA fixes. Consider updating to a newer version of those packages, they may no longer be affected by the reported CVEs.

|clamav-scan |Scans the content of container images for viruses, malware, and other malicious content using ClamAV antivirus scanner. | A malware has been found.

|sast-snyk-check |Scans and analyze source code or compiled versions of code to help find security flaws using Snyk Code. | For details, review Tekton task log.
