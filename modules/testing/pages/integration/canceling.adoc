= Canceling Integration pipelineRuns

== How do I cancel the previous pipelineRun and which will be canceled?

=== Canceling integration pipelineRuns manually
Users are allowed to cancel running pipelineRun themselves, you can do that by pressing Cancel in a dropdown menu next to the pipelineRun in the {ProductName} UI.

=== Automatic canceling of integration pipelineRuns
You have a Pull Request created and build pipelineRun has just succeeded.
If your integration tests are still running and you push new changes to your Pull Request, once new build pipelineRun succeeds and new snapshot is created,
integration service will gracefully cancel previous integration test pipelineRun.
Each time newer snapshot is created it will be registered by integration service as a latest one and every older snapshot for that Pull Request will be considered obsolete. That means old snapshots will be marked as canceled, same applies for integration test pipelineRuns.
