= Editing integration tests

Once you have xref:./adding.adoc[added] an Integration Test Scenario to {ProductName}, you may want to change the configurations for it. 

.Prerequisites

* You have xref:./adding.adoc[added an integration test] in {ProductName}.

.Procedure

Complete the following steps in the {ProductName} console:

. Open an existing application and go to the *Integration tests* tab.

. Select the three dots on the right side of the table.

. Select the *Edit* action.

. Make any changes to the test that are needed

    * Modify the *GitHub URL* if you need to specify a different repository.
    * Modify the *Revision* if you need to use a different branch, tag, or commit in the repository.
    * Modify the *Path in repository* to point to a new location for the `.yaml` file.
    * Add or remove *Parameters* which are passed to the integration test scenario.
    * Modify whether this integration test scenario is required or optional for release.

+
NOTE: A failing integration test marks the application snapshot as failed. A failing required test will prevent the automated release. If you have selected *Mark as optional for release*, a failure in this test will still result in an automated release of the application snapshot.

. Select *Save changes*.

. To start building a new component (and afterwards trigger a new integration test), either open a new pull request (PR) that targets the tracked branch of a component in the application, or comment '/retest' on an existing PR.

.Timeouts

It is possible to define custom timeouts on the pipeline level for individual IntegrationTestScenarios.
There are three timeouts that need to be defined:

* `Tasks` - specifies the timeout for the cumulative time taken by Tasks specified in `pipeline.spec.tasks`
* `Finally` - specifies the timeout for the cumulative time taken by finally Tasks specified in `pipeline.spec.finally`
* `Pipeline` - specifies the timeout for the entire PipelineRun.
** The sum of the other two timeouts must be equal to this timeout, otherwise the integration pipelineRuns will fail on creation.

NOTE: Since the integration service already sets default timeouts to integration pipelineRuns, it is necessary to set all of the above timeouts to prevent errors.

You can define the above timeouts by setting the annotations on the IntegrationTestScenario in the following
way through the CLI (consult the steps listed in the xref:ROOT:getting-started.adoc#getting-started-with-the-cli[Getting started in the CLI] page):

[source,bash]
----
kubectl annotate integrationtestscenario/[scenario name] test.appstudio.openshift.io/finally_timeout=3h --overwrite
kubectl annotate integrationtestscenario/[scenario name] test.appstudio.openshift.io/tasks_timeout=5h --overwrite
kubectl annotate integrationtestscenario/[scenario name] test.appstudio.openshift.io/pipeline_timeout=8h --overwrite

== Configuring the enterprise contract policy

All applications created in {ProductName} will have one integration test scenario to enable xref:/compliance[manage compliance with Conforma] by default. You can configure your tests to use a customized link:https://conforma.dev/docs/user-guide/custom-config.html#_using_an_enterprisecontractpolicy_kubernetes_custom_resource_cr[Kubernetes Custom Resource] policy on the cluster.

.Procedure

Complete the following steps in the {ProductName} console:

. Open an existing application and go to the *Integration tests* tab.

. Select the three dots on the right side of the table.

. Select the *Edit* action.

. Click on *Add parameter*.

    * In *Name*, write `POLICY_CONFIGURATION`
    * In *Value*, write the namespace and CR name for the policy, `<namespace>/<policy-name>`

. Click on *Save changes*.

. To start building a new component (and afterwards trigger a new integration test), either open a new pull request (PR) that targets the tracked branch of a component in the application, or comment '/retest' on an existing PR.

.Verification

When the new build is finished:

. Go to the *Integration tests* tab and select the highlighted name of your test.

. Go to the *Pipeline runs* tab of that test and select the most recent run.

.  On the *Details* page, you can see if the test succeeded for that component. The policy used by the test should be updated.
