= Integration tests

This document covers the integration tests that {ProductName} triggers after component build pipelines. 

Integration tests ensure that all built components conform to some set of requirements. xref:testing:integration/adding.adoc[Adding an integration test] is as simple as providing a reference to a git repository and the path to the Tekton pipeline that defines the test.

After a successful build pipeline, a snapshot is created with the just-produced component and the remaining component references from the application's Global Candidate List. The configured integration test scenarios are then run against this snapshot. Note that in order for integration tests to successfully run, the service requires a valid pullspec for the components. If you need to run the snapshots through custom checks, you can also xref:testing:integration/creating.adoc[create your own integration tests].

The integration service provides users with the ability to reset their component’s Global Candidate List to a desired state with a manually created `override`. You can xref:testing:integration/creating.adoc[create an override snapshot] and provide a valid container image for a component to reset the component’s Global Candidate List.

{ProductName} configures one integration test for all applications to enable xref:/compliance[manage compliance with Conforma] by default. As with any other integration test, you can xref:testing:integration/editing.adoc[edit the tests] including setting parameter values (for example the enterprise contract policy evaluated) and whether the tests are required to pass before the snapshot is promoted.
