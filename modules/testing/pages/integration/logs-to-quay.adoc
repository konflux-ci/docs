= Export Pipeline Logs to Quay

Use the `export-pipeline-logs` task to gather all execution logs from a completed Tekton PipelineRun and package them into a compressed `tar.gz` artifact.

The task waits for all other TaskRuns in the PipelineRun to complete, excluding itself. It then iterates through each underlying Pod to retrieve and collect the complete log stream.

Push the archived log data as a secure OCI artifact to the same registry location as the build image, SBOM, and source code artifacts.

Download and extract this log data artifact by using the `oras` command-line tool.

Call this task in the `finally` section of the PipelineRun.
