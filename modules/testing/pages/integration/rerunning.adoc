= Retriggering Integration Tests

Integration test(s) for a given snapshot can be re-triggered by adding the `test.appstudio.openshift.io/run` label to the snapshot.

See also xref:building:rerunning.adoc[Retriggering build pipelines].

== Supported Values for the label

* `all`: Reruns all the IntegrationTestScenarios (both optional and required) whose contexts match the snapshot.
Example command:

[source]
----
$ kubectl label snapshot [snapshot name] test.appstudio.openshift.io/run=all
----

* `[scenario name]`: Reruns a specific IntegrationTestScenario, regardless of whether its context matches the snapshot. Replace [scenario name] with the name of the IntegrationTestScenario you want to retrigger.
Example command:

[source]
----
$ kubectl label snapshot [snapshot name] test.appstudio.openshift.io/run=[scenario name]
----

== Prerequisites

- You have a snapshot that has completed all its initial tests. All initial tests must be finished before you trigger subsequent tests.
- The snapshot for which tests will be retriggered has completed its initial tests.
- You have CLI access to the specific OpenShift cluster. For information on obtaining CLI access, refer xref:ROOT:getting-started.adoc#getting-started-with-the-cli[Getting started with the CLI].

== Procedure

Identify the snapshot to retrigger tests for. You can find the related snapshot on the pipelineRun details page in the UI.
Example:

image::snapshot.png[role="border" alt="IntegrationTestScenario Snapshot"]

Retrigger via UI:

. Click on the three vertical dots on the right side of the pipelineRun details page seen above.
. From the expanded menu, select "Rerun".

Retrigger via CLI:

. Add the `test.appstudio.openshift.io/run` label to the snapshot, with any of the supported values as shown above.
. The tests are re-triggered automatically. Once they are re-triggered, the system removes the label, allowing you to apply a new label for a different scenario if you want to test multiple scenarios. Verify that the test(s) have started.

[Example Output]
NAME                            STARTED         DURATION   STATUS
integration-pipelinerun-jfrdb   4 seconds ago   ---        Running
----

+
NOTE: If you run the command long after retriggering, the pipelineRun might have been pruned. The output may also include other unrelated pipelineRuns.

== Verification

. To verify the tests, run `tkn pipelinerun describe [pipelinerun]` and ensure that the labels `appstudio.openshift.io/snapshot` and `test.appstudio.openshift.io/scenario` reference the correct snapshot and scenario.
