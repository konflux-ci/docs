= Jenkins

In this guide, you'll learn how to xref:testing:integration/adding.adoc[add a custom integration test] in {ProductName} that triggers a link:https://www.jenkins.io/[jenkins] job in a jenkins instance outside of konflux using the jenkins link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/remote-access-api/[remote access API].

.Prerequisites

. You have xref:building:creating.adoc[created an application] in {ProductName}

. You have the **url** of the jenkins instance and the **name** of the job you want to trigger.

. You have a jenkins **username** and jenkins **API token** that can be used to initiate jobs in your jenkins instance.

. Your jenkins job has a **parameter** that allows you to specify the artifact from konflux.

.Procedure

You need to perform three major steps. Write your trigger pipeline using a shared task, upload your Jenkins API credentials to {ProductName}, and register an *Integration test* with {ProductName} to send requests to the Jenkins API. Complete the following steps in the {ProductName} console:

.Procedure - Writing the test pipeline

We'll make use of a shared link:https://github.com/konflux-ci/tekton-integration-catalog/blob/main/tasks/triggers/jenkins/0.1/README.md[trigger jenkins job] task.

Similar to the instructions in the xref:testing:integration/creating.adoc[creating an integration test] guide, commit the following Pipeline definition to a file named `pipelines/jenkins.yaml` in a repository under your control, like `https://github.com/your-org/your-tests-repo`.

.Procedure - Upload your Jenkins API key

Follow the instructions in the xref:building:creating-secrets.adoc[creating secrets] guide, with the following details:

. For **Secret name**, enter `my-jenkins-credentials`.

. Under **Key/value secret**, expand **Key/value 1**, then enter the key name `username`. Supply the jenkins username in the field.

. Under **Key/value secret**, expand **Key/value 2**, then enter the key name `apitoken`. Paste the API token into the field.

.Procedure - Registering the Integration Test

Follow the instructions in the xref:testing:integration/adding.adoc[adding an integration test] guide, with the following details:

. In the *GitHub URL* field, enter `https://github.com/your-org/your-tests-repo`, which is a git repository containing a tekton pipeline and task that can send requests to the Testing Farm API.

. In the *Path in repository* field, enter `pipelines/jenkins.yaml`, which refers to the pipeline you created in the previous section.

. Expand the *Parameters* field.

. Select *Add parameter*. For the *Name* field, enter `JENKINS_HOST_URL`. For the *Value* field, enter the url to the jenkins instance you want to trigger.

. Select *Add parameter*. For the *Name* field, enter `JOB_NAME`. For the *Value* field, enter the url to the jenkins job you want to trigger.

.Verification

To start building a new component, either open a new pull request (PR) that targets the tracked branch of the component in the GitHub repository, or comment '/retest' on an existing PR.

When the new build is finished:

. Go to the *Integration tests* tab and select the highlighted name of your test.

. Go to the *Pipeline runs* tab of that test and select the most recent run.

. You should be able to find the jenkins URLs in the logs.

. xref:testing:integration/editing.adoc[Edit the integration test] if it is not properly configured.
