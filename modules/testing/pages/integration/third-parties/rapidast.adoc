= RapiDAST

link:https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/rapidast[RapiDAST] is a tool for performing dynamic application security testing (DAST) on _running_ applications.

Therefore, it's recommended to use a xref:testing:integration/adding.adoc[custom integration test] to deploy the target application, and perform a RapiDAST scan inside that same integration test.

NOTE: RapiDAST scans are intended for testing environments and should not be used on production systems.

.Prerequisites

- An xref:building:creating.adoc[application] created in {ProductName}
- A RapiDAST configuration for testing this application. For more information, see the link:https://redhatproductsecurity.github.io/rapidast/#/USER-GUIDE?id=configuration[RapiDAST documentation]

It is recommended to first create a RapiDAST config file for the target application by manual testing outside of Konflux, as this is usually faster than repeated runs of integration tests.

.Procedure

Create a Tekton Pipeline for use in an xref:testing:integration[IntegrationTest], see this link:https://github.com/redhatproductsecurity/rapidast/blob/development/examples/konflux/[example pipeline].

At a high level, this example does the following:

. *Provision Environment*: Creates an ephemeral environment to deploy the application
. *Deploy Application*: Deploys the application using the snapshot from an earlier build pipeline
. *Run RapiDAST Scan*: Runs RapiDAST to scan the deployed application

.Verification

. Trigger a run of the Integration Test (e.g. by opening a new pull request)
. Browse to the *Integration tests* tab of the {ProductName} UI and find the RapiDAST test, verify it succeeded
. Review any security issues reported by RapiDAST
