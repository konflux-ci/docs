== PipelineRuns stuck in a Pending state

A PipelineRun might get stuck in a 'Pending' status because a requested resource is not available.

To diagnose this issue, check the status of the Workload owned by the PipelineRun, which should have the same name as the PipelineRun. Look for a message similar to `resource <VM_TYPE> unavailable in ClusterQueue` like this:

....
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2026-01-21T17:25:41Z"
    message: 'couldn''t assign flavors to pod set pod-set-1: resource <VM_TYPE>
      unavailable in ClusterQueue'
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: Pending
    status: "False"
    type: QuotaReserved
  resourceRequests:
  - name: pod-set-1
    resources:
      <VM_TYPE>: "1"
      tekton.dev/pipelineruns: "1"

....



[1] If the platform `flavor` name contains invalid characters (any characters other than alphanumeric, `-`, or `_`), the PipelineRun fails with a `resource key validation failed` error.
