= Troubleshooting Registry Issues

== Failed to push or pull image

Failing to authenticate with a container registry can be hard to debug. To be able to troubleshoot
effectively, one needs to understand how registry authentication works in Tekton. For the full
details, see the Tekton link:https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/auth/[Authentication] docs. In short:

. Tekton uses a ServiceAccount (named `appstudio-pipeline` by default in {ProductName}) to run your Pipeline.
. This ServiceAccount has a list of `imagePullSecrets` and `secrets`.
.. Tekton uses the `imagePullSecrets` when pulling the images that execute the Tasks in your pipeline.
   These images are typically hard-coded in the Task definition and publicly accessible. As a {ProductName}
   user, you're more interested in the `secrets`.
.. Tekton injects the `secrets` into the execution environment so that the tools executed inside
   the Tasks (e.g. `buildah`, `skopeo`, `oras`, `cosign`) can authenticate to registries.

Tekton takes all the `dockercfg` and `dockerconfigjson` secrets linked in `secrets` (as well as
link:https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/auth/#configuring-basic-auth-authentication-for-docker[specially annotated]
`basic-auth` secrets), merges them into a single file and injects the file into the Task Pod at
`~/.docker/config.json`. The format of the file is described in the
link:https://github.com/containers/image/blob/main/docs/containers-auth.json.5.md[containers-auth.json manpage].

Note that the merged file can contain multiple credentials for a single registry, distinguished by
path. For example:

[source,json]
----
{
  "auths": {
    "quay.io/my-org": {
      "auth": "..."
    },
    "quay.io": {
      "auth": "..."
    }
  }
}
----

The most specific path takes precedence. When accessing images in `quay.io/my-org/`, the tool will
prefer the `quay.io/my-org` credential over the generic `quay.io` credential (assuming the tool
implements the `containers-auth.json` spec correctly).

More tips and tricks for debugging below.

=== Check if a secret has access to a registry / to a specific image

_Prerequisites: `jq`, `kubectl` or `oc`, access to the Secrets in the namespace._

[source,bash]
----
secret_name=secret-for-my-registry
should_have_access_to=my.registry.io/my-org/my-image

kubectl get secret "$secret_name" -o json |
    jq '.data[] | @base64d | fromjson | {auths: (.auths // .)}' |
    tee /tmp/auth.json

# Check if a tool can use the authfile to access a registry / an image. E.g. skopeo:
skopeo login --authfile /tmp/auth.json "$should_have_access_to"
----

Note: works for `dockercfg` and `dockerconfigjson` secrets, not `basic-auth`.

[#check-if-the-secret-is-linked-to-the-service-account]
=== Check if the secret is linked to the `appstudio-pipeline` service account

In order to connect the new secret to pipeline run, you need to link it from service account used by Tekton to run the pipeline run.
Check if your secret appears in the `secrets` section:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get sa appstudio-pipeline -o json
----

If not, link it to the `appstudio-pipeline` service account with:

[source,bash]
----
secret_name=secret-for-my-registry

# using kubectl
kubectl patch serviceaccount appstudio-pipeline -p "{\"secrets\": [{\"name\": \"$secret_name\"}]}"

# using oc
oc secrets link appstudio-pipeline "$secret_name"
----

=== Get the merged registry auth file

_Prerequisites: `jq`, `kubectl` or `oc`, access to the Secrets in the namespace._

This script roughly approximates Tekton's merging of `dockercfg` and `dockerconfigjson` secrets.
It does not handle `basic-auth` secrets.

The output is a `containers-auth.json` file (you can e.g. save it as `/tmp/auth.json` and use it the
same way as in the example above). Each entry in the file has an extra `_from_secret` attribute
showing which Secret provides the entry. This may be useful to determine which Secret is introducing
problematic content into the merged file.

[source,bash]
----
linked_secrets=$(kubectl get sa appstudio-pipeline -o json | jq '.secrets | map(.name)')

kubectl get secrets -o json |
    jq --argjson linked_secrets "$linked_secrets" '
        .items | map(
            . as $secret |
            select($linked_secrets | index($secret.metadata.name)) |
            .data | .[".dockercfg"], .[".dockerconfigjson"] | select(. != null) |
            @base64d | fromjson |
            .auths // . |
            to_entries[] |
            {registry: .key, config: .value, secret: $secret.metadata.name}
        ) |
        reduce .[] as $x ({}; .[$x.registry] = $x.config + {_from_secret: $x.secret}) |
        {auths: .}
    '
