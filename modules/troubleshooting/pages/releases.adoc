= Troubleshooting Releases

== Release fails because of signature check

- Check if push pipeline has `chains.tekton.dev/signed=failed` annotation.
- That means that it failed on chains.
- If chains is failing with `POST https://quay.io/v2/image-path/blobs/uploads/: UNAUTHORIZED: access to the requested resource is not authorized; map[]`.
- Since build was successful, problem is with component specific service account `build-pipeline-$COMPONENT_NAME`
  which has in `imagePullSecrets` section some wrongly added pull secrets for registry.
- In imagePullSecrets should be only `appstudio-pipeline-dockercfg-*` secret which provides access to
  pipeline/task bundles.
